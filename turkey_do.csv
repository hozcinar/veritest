2002;in recent years internet became an indispensable part of our modem society and it is an undeniable reality that it will continue to play a decisive role in various aspects of our modem life. it is used educationally to wipe the imbalance of teaching and to decrease the cost of education. this paper gives a detailed look about what the distance education is and the comparison of currently used systems for distance education. we have implemented a new distance education model named deu-deu that structured completely by database-oriented components. our database contains administrators instructors and students information and also consists of all materials related to education. and finally we give our systems' advantages and possible problems and the solutions to these problems.
2003;there have been many technological dawns in the last 30 years during which the desktop computer and the internet have been developed. the importance of internet in education particularly using its web is a well-recognized fact. a wealth of resources and techniques now exist which serve as a source both for exciting examples of new teaching practices as well as easily accessible methods for adoption into various formats of teaching and learning. internet technology allow teachers and students keep up with their minds. it let them try their ideas as soon as they come up with them. generally students appreciate the convenience choice and flexibility that an online courses offers. instructional designers value the standardized framework and flexibility. webmathematica is a web-based technology developed by wolfram research that allows the generation of dynamic web content with mathematica. with this technology the distance education students should be able to explore and experiment with the mathematical concepts. in this paper we will elucidate the pedagogical issues in the application of hamiltonian systems in the webmathematica for the distance learning environment and the shape of the future classroom as well as relevant educational strategies towards improving mathematics education.
2003;this paper presents an overview of the design and implementation of an activity planning and progress following tool (apt) for e-learning. apt is a software based support tool designed to assist learners with their self directed distance learning (sddl). a literature survey for the additional components of learning management systems (lms) that are needed for sddl is conducted. as a result the importance of planning feedback and resources proper-ties are revealed. in the continuation of the study apt was developed by adding recommended study time periods resources study planning user goals and progress report modules to the content administration tool (cat) which was developed before in another study.
2005;in order to benefit from e-learning companies should conduct considerable up-front analysis to assess their readiness. there are a number of instruments in the market that can be used for assessing readiness for e-learning. however almost all of these instruments are developed to be used in countries that have a mature field of human resources development. so these instruments consist of terms phrases and applications that are meaningless for many companies in especially emerging countries where human resources development field has just shown an improvement. this article includes the description of a survey instrument that has been developed to assess e-learning readiness of companies in these kinds of countries and the results of a study that examines organizational readiness of companies for e-learning in turkey. the study reveals that companies surveyed are overall ready for e-learning but they need to improve need to improve themselves particularly in the area of human resources in order to be able to successfully implement e-learning. although this instrument has been developed according to the cultural characteristics of turkish companies it can easily be adapted to be used by companies of other emerging countries.
2005;this paper explores the use of e-learning technologies for organisational learning within a commercial environment. a model has been developed to represent those factors that determine organisational learning. this model has been embedded within a case study based on the use of an e-learning program that was developed in order to enhance employees' knowledge and endorse corporate values within a norwegian company. the results of the study reflect the high performance of the e-learning program. they also highlight critical issues concerning the successful implementation of e-learning technologies to achieve the knowledge sharing that is required for organisational learning.
2006;on-line collaboration is an instructional method that facilitates collaboration in an on-line learning setting. to promote effective collaboration it is vital to reveal both the student's and the instructor's point of view pertaining to effective on-line collaboration. in this study the effectiveness of a learning management system in on-line collaboration was first investigated in a graduate course offered through the means of distance learning. in this first phase of this study the nature of collaboration the students perceptions of the effectiveness of the tool in on-line collaboration the factors contributing to effective peer interaction among students and the role of the instructor as perceived by the students in the on-line course were explored. this phase of the study also involved the reviews of other learning management systems course management systems and groupware systems regarding the tools used to encourage collaboration. also revealed was a lack of diversity in collaboration tools. based on these preliminary findings an on-line document reviewing tool was developed and pilot tested in the second phase of the study. in this phase a web-based synchronous collaborative review tool called webscore is proposed to promote online collaboration. webscore is proposed as an attempt to develop and implement a new platform for on-line document reviewing to promote effective on-line collaboration among students and the instructor.
2007;this study analyzed the factors that affect student success in an online computer programming course. the study had two with two main objectives. the first was to examine relationships among selected variables (gender age educational level locus of control and learning style) motivational beliefs (intrinsic goal orientation extrinsic goal orientation control beliefs task value self-efficacy and test anxiety) self-regulated learning components (cognitive strategy use self-regulation) and student success in the online course. the second objective was to examine course instructors' views about the factors that contribute to the students' success in the online course. the study sample consisted of two course instructors and 80 voluntary participants who partook in this online course in 2005-2006. both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect relevant data in this study. four online questionnaires (demographic survey internal-external locus of control scale learning style inventory and motivated strategies for learning questionnaire) were used to gather data on quantitative variables and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data on instructors' views. the statistical results indicated that the effect of the self-regulation variables on students' success was statistically significant and the interview results indicated that successful students generally used self-regulated learning strategies in the online course.
2007;this study is a presentation of the usage of distance education technologies in a bid to support face to face education of tourist guide candidates during the training tour. the laws require tourist guide candidates to successfully complete their internship tour and get a certificate. since the time in this internship period is limited and there are restricting factors such as transportation accommodation many of the tourism places couldn't be included in this internship period. besides the lack of experienced and competent guides in the visited places is also another negative factor reducing the quality and efficiency of the training. technological support of the training of tourist guide candidates would effectively reduce the negativities of traditional education methods. thus benefiting from computer technologies and audiovisual systems during the internship of tourist guide candidates would result in an increase in the effectiveness and usefulness of the training tour and would make it possible to visit more places in a shorter period. this study is a presentation on how distance education method could be implemented and an attempt to show the benefits could be obtained from implementation of these methods along with the possible problems that are predicted to arise.
2007;all-optical wavelength-routed wdm wans can support the high bandwidth and the long session duration requirements of the application scenarios such as interactive distance learning or on-line diagnosis of patients simultaneously in different hospitals. however multifiber and limited sparse light splitting and wavelength conversion capabilities of switches result in a difficult optimization problem. we attack this problem using a layered graph model. the problem is defined as a k-edge-disjoint degree-constrained steiner tree problem for routing and fiber and wavelength assignment of k multicasts. a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the problem is given and a solution using cplex is provided. however the complexity of the problem grows quickly with respect to the number of edges in the layered graph which depends on the number of nodes fibers wavelengths and multicast sessions. hence we propose two heuristics layered all-optical multicast algorithm [( lama) and conservative fiber and wavelength assignment (c-fwa)] to compare with cplex existing work and unicasting. extensive computational experiments show that lama's performance is very close to cplex and it is significantly better than existing work and c-fwa for nearly all metrics since lama jointly optimizes routing and fiber-wavelength assignment phases compared with the other candidates which attack the problem by decomposing two phases. experiments also show that important metrics (e. g. session and group blocking probability transmitter wavelength and fiber conversion resources) are adversely affected by the separation of two phases. finally the fiber- wavelength assignment strategy of c-fwa (ex-fit) uses wavelength and fiber conversion resources more effectively than the first fit.

2007;the proliferation of the internet and world wide web applications has created new opportunities as well as new challenges for institutions and individuals who are either receiving or delivering education. electronic (e) learning is one of the most important developments in education. it recognizes the shift from teaching to learning and puts the learner or user before the institution. the objectives and expected outcomes of e-learning are largely dependent on the quality of the teaching processes and the effectiveness of online access. hence assessing methods for the effectiveness of e-learning web sites are a critical issue in both practice and research. however web site quality is a complex concept and its measurement is expected to be multidimensional in nature. multicriteria decision-making (mcdm) techniques are widely used for evaluating and ranking such problems containing multiple usually conflicting criteria. for this reason this article presents a quality evaluation model based on the mcdm to measure the e-learning web sites' performance. in addition the subjectivity and vagueness in the assessment process are dealt with using fuzzy logic. the study has investigated 10 worldwide and 11 locally successful web sites with the proposed method. by suggesting an aggregated measure based on the web site quality criteria it is expected that the method could be useful to the e-learning service providers and system developers as well as to the researchers related with web research.

2007;problem statement: entry to turkish higher education is highly competitive. high school graduates gain access to universities based upon their performance on the student selection examination (sse) which about two million students take each year. only 10% of these students are placed in undergraduate degree programs (excluding distance education programs). students commonly start preparing for the exam during their elementary school years. the preparation often includes attendance to private prepatory schools (dershaneler). preparation becomes highly stressful particularly during high school years. purpose: the purpose of this to investigate depression test anxiety and social support of students preparing for the sse and in so doing drawing attention to issues faced by these students. methods: a total of 844 students attending to private preparatory schools in the capital city of ankara (56% females 44% males) participated in this study. beck depression inventory (bdi-1978 formu) test anxiety inventory (tae) the perceived social support scale-revised (psss-r) and personal information form (developed by the researcher) were used for data collection. individuals with scores of 17 or higher on the bdi were considered depressed 13-16 mildly depressed and those lower than 12 were regarded as not depressed. scores of 46 or higher on the test anxiety inventory were considered high level of test anxiety. findings: data analyses showed that 36% of students were depressed and 42% had high degree of test anxiety. depression was more prevalent among females students with lower levels of achievement 11(th) graders and high school graduates. level of depression did not differ significantly according to the kind of high school attended. results also showed that depressed students scored higher on test anxiety than non-depressed ones. on the contrary depressed students reported lower levels of support from family friends and teachers. recommendations: greater prevalence of depression among females is worth further examination. high schools should develop psycho-educational programs for teachers and families in order to enhance support for students preparing for the sse. teachers and families can be informed about needs of students with lower achievement level. interventions targeting students' test anxiety might also alleviate depressive symptoms and improve their achievement levels. school guidance programs and particularly counseling services can be enriched. future research can explore other aspects of these students' functioning including social and developmental issues studies could also focus on family dynamics of students with depression and anxiety.
2007;the main purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss the main characteristics of project-based online learning (pbol) to promote learners' critical learning skills through reusable learning objects (rlos) from global online resources. based on the main purpose of this study and the concerns the key research inquiries are: (1) how does a pbol environment improve the learners' critical thinking skills via rlos? (2) what are the patterns of the learners' critical thinking skills in a pbol environment when they focus on building and delivering rlos? and (3) what are the learning impacts and communicational outcomes of a pbol environment on the learners' critical thinking skills when they work with rlos? this is a qualitative case study that utilizes both qualitative and quantitative data to provide detailed information to the researcher for the data collection. the research site was the designing and delivering an e-learning environment graduate course at the department of distance education of social sciences institute in the large urban and government-based university in the spring semester 2004. there were totally i i learners (three of them were men and the rest of them were women) in this course.

2008;the purpose of the study is to investigate some of the factors that contribute to satisfaction of participants in an online information technologies certificate program (itcp). the program includes eight courses and lasts four semesters. the sample consisted of 30 participants who enrolled to the program and 8 instructors who gave the courses in this program in 2004-2005. the data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative methods. an online questionnaire was used to gather data on participants' satisfaction about the program semi-structured interviews were conducted with both the participants and the instructors to analyze the factors that contribute to satisfaction in the program and asynchronous and synchronous communication transcripts were examined to support the findings. descriptive statistics were reported upon the participants' satisfaction in regard to learner-learner interaction learner-instructor interaction course structure institutional support and flexibility. a repeated measure analysis test was utilized to see the changes in the participants' satisfaction throughout this online program based on semester one two three and four. the results of the study showed that even though the participants' overall satisfaction was generally positive it decreased significantly toward the final semesters of the program. the findings highlighted some of the critical issues such as learning community formation through interaction well structured and guided project or problem-based group activities considering instructional design and cognitive principles in the design of the program and flexibility in time and selection of the courses that should be taken into account in designing online programs.
2008;the rapid growth in the use of learning technologies particularly the use of the web based technologies and communications have offered educators with many more opportunities to investigate the most suitable learning environments for their students' learning styles. the purpose of the present study was to examine the students' learning styles and their views on blended learning. the study was conducted with thirty-four students at hacettepe university ankara turkey. the two instruments were the questionnaire designed to identify students' views on blended learning and kolb's learning style inventory (lsi) to measure students' learning styles. additional data were gathered from achievement scores of students and records demonstrate students' participation to e - learning environment. results revealed that students' views on blended learning process such as ease of use of the web environment evaluation face to face environment etc. differ according to their learning styles. results also revealed that the highest mean score corresponds to face to face aspect of the process when students' evaluation concerning the implementation is taken to consideration. the overall findings showed no significant differences between students' achievement level according to their learning styles.
2008;in the current study the distance education student satisfaction model estimated as a structural equation model is proposed to understand better what predicts student satisfaction from online learning environments. in the present study the following variables are employed based on the technology acceptance model (tam) (davis bagozzi & warshaw 1989) and literature: computer knowledge flexibility of distance education usefulness of distance education and distance education satisfaction. results suggest that as long as students have the skills to use online tools and perceive that distance education is a useful and flexible way of learning communicating and sharing their enjoyment from online instruction will be promoted. ultimately this satisfaction may lead to higher levels of engagement learning and success in the distance education setting. data collected from 195 undergraduate students are analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences and analysis of moment structures statistical software. implications of the findings of the present study are crucial for instructors practitioners and institutions planning to offer or currently engaged in offering distance education courses.
2008;problem statement: continuous change and improvements for the quality of organizational development communication flow and knowledge sharing are crucial within institutions. recent studies have paid a great deal of attention to the importance of learning organisations and emphasize distance education practices as an innovative strategy. this study fills a gap in the literature by using a comparative study to examine the distance education institutes as learning organisations. the study is significant as it compares the performance of distance education institutes as learning organizations. it also helps to identify quality improvements of learning organisations and provides insights to evaluate the integration of sharing learning in higher education practices within different cultural contexts. purpose of the study: the purpose of the study is to investigate the comparison between the performances of the distance education institutes in north cyprus and the uk higher education institutions. these institutes' performances as learning organizations give a competitive advantage to their higher education system. methods: the qualitative research method including in-depth interviews researcher observations and self-reports were used to examine these institutes. data were then analyzed thematically and triangulated. the participants from north cyprus and uk were purposefully selected as a sample on a voluntary basis. the multiple data collection techniques were reviewed by experts from turkey uk and united states and piloted in order to increase the credibility of the research. findings and results: findings revealed that higher education institutions need to use distance education practices as an innovative strategy for continuous improvement. in addition findings show that the distance education institute in the uk performs better as a learning organization than the distance education institute in north cyprus which has limited infrastructure and lacks a collective vision. conclusions and recommendations: the research findings suggest that developing a learning organization with distance education practices provides an opportunity for the higher education system to extend its influence on external and multicultural environments. there is also an increasing need to provide strategic planning and evaluation of its effectiveness for the development of distance education institutes as learning organizations. in addition to the two cases examined other comparisons could also be made considering the cultural dimensions. furthermore social interaction such as dialogue and inquiry can be explored using in-depth investigation to enrich other dimensions of learning organizations and improve organizational performance.
2008;this study focuses on a synchronous e-class project which was developed to increase the effectiveness of a second year advanced reading course within the distance english language teacher training (deltt) program in turkey. the aim of the study is to explore the perceptions of learners who participated in the e-class application and the impact of it on their success in their studies. from 675 second year learners in the deltt program 26 were selected as the subjects of this study. the perceptions of the e-class participants were gathered from diaries they kept for each e-class session. three main categories of perceptions emerged from the analysis of these diaries. these are learner attitudes about the application of the e-class about group work activities used and about various technological aspects. the conclusion drawn from the data is that in spite of some concerns turkish learners perceived the e-class to be a very efficient way of conducting reading classes. a statistical analysis of exam scores supported participant perceptions and revealed that an e-class application can be as effective as the traditional face-to-face classroom mode. the findings suggest that an e-class could be used to increase the effectiveness of the distance teacher training program and has further implications for training future teachers.
2008;quality function deployment (qfd) is a product/service design and improvement tool used to achieve higher customer satisfaction. basically qfd is a transformation of vague and imprecise customer needs into measurable product/service attributes. this article integrates compromise programming based goal programming into the qfd process to determine to what extent the product/service attributes should be improved. the fuzzy set theory is applied to the model to deal with the imprecise nature of data. differing from existing qfd applications our proposed methodology applies analytic network process (anp) to evaluate the inner dependencies among customer needs among product attributes and also the relationships between them. furthermore it determines the best product/service in the market as the goal employing compromise programming. finally the methodology ends with the goal programming method which consists of this predefined goal and the product/service provider's budget limitation. the aim is to improve the performance values of the selected product/service according to the best one. a real-world application on e-learning products provided by the higher education institutions in turkey illustrates the applicability of our proposed methodology.
2008;remote laboratories are technologies that aim to increase the effectiveness of educational programs. european remote radio laboratory (errl) is an e-learning project for students teachers and technicians who will use very important devices of a radio frequency laboratory remotely. as a solution we have developed an e-learning system which aims to support the errl learners while studying on how to use equipments in the system. the system is developed according to the electronic performance support system (epss) approach. an epss is a computer-based well-structured system which improves the performance of individuals. it is an electronic infrastructure that contains stores and distributes personal (individual) or corporate knowledge to enable people to reach necessary levels of performance in the fastest possible time and with minimum teaching support of other people. this paper discusses how the content for such a system is developed and how this content is interactively used in the epss platform. the technical details of the developed epss are also discussed in this study. we believe that this paper will help instructional system designers for designing different alternatives to improve learners' performance.
2008;in this research the articles concerning interaction in the internet-based distance learning which were published in three most outstanding journals in 2003 2004 and until march of 2005 have been examined and classified. the research provides opportunities for discussing topics methods and some other variables. it is thought that the research will be useful for reviewing current researching trends concerning interaction and displaying what kinds of potential researches about this topic can be done and bringing up the deficiencies of the field.
2008;this exploratory study tests the assertion that instructional strategies that match field-dependence status of students are most effective. the study conducted with 12 graduate students registered in a graduate level online course. an online version of the psychological differentiation inventory was used to measure the field-dependence status of students. students' perceived learning outcomes their effort and involvement and level of interaction that they perceived in online course module were measured through an online questionnaire. results suggested that matches between students' learning styles and instructional strategies did not affect learner perception of their own learning outcomes level of effort and involvement and level of interactions in the course. data also indicated that no single instructional strategy among three instructional strategies tested emerged as superior for high and low field-dependent online students.

2008;japan and korea have highly developed information and communications technology infrastructures and have recently reformed their higher education systems and encouraged e-transformation. however japanese universities have not embraced e-learning as wholeheartedly as their korean counterparts. the paper concludes that this is due to governmental and institutional failure to develop a cogent vision and strategic plan for e-learning to recognise the need for fundamental shifts in organisational cultures and structures and pedagogy and to provide training funding recognition and reward for such development. it attributes this to differences in the cultural perspectives values and customs of the two countries' policy makers managers and faculty members. the findings are seen to hold important lessons for other countries embarking on e-transformation.
2008;there are a significant number of studies in the literature stressing the important role of teacher immediacy behaviors on learners' perceptions of social presence and satisfaction in open and distance learning environments. yet those studies were conducted in different open and distance education institutions than the current example of which unique characteristics and applications are commonly recognized in the field. unlike others the current study examined the effects of both verbal and nonverbal instructor immediacy behaviors on learners' perceptions of social presence and satisfaction in face-to-face academic tutoring services provided in open and distance learning environments. results indicated a moderate and positive relationship between the control variable and outcome variables.
2008;using the model for learning and teaching activities (molta) a new technology enhanced hybrid instruction was designed developed and implemented. the effectiveness of the hybrid instruction in regard to students' achievement knowledge retention attitudes towards the subject and course satisfaction was evaluated in comparison to traditional classroom instruction. experimental study with pre-test post-test control group design was carried out. the sample of the study consisted of 50 university students enrolled in computer networks and communication course. the control and experimental groups composed of 24 and 26 students respectively and the experiment lasted 14 weeks. the findings of the study indicated no significant difference between the hybrid course and the traditional course in students' achievement knowledge retention satisfaction and attitude.

2009;a distributed online curriculum and courseware development model (donc2) is developed and tested in this study. courseware development teams which may work in different institutions who need to develop high quality reduced cost on time products will be the users of donc2. the related features from the disciplines of instructional design and software engineering were combined. the research is conducted as a collective case study including four cases with distinctive characteristics to reveal the several practices in online curriculum and courseware development work. the donc2 development model was proposed using the results gathered from the investigated cases and a literature survey. the model uses the iterative incremental and agile software development approaches in order to overcome the disadvantages of other linear development approaches. this enables building releasable yet good quality products in short time periods. furthermore continuous communication evaluation and feedback as well as good project management and readiness to adapt to changes are integrated as the essential characteristics. donc2 is different then previous linear and non-adaptive models in all of these aspects. the model was tested with one of the cases while being improved with success. it was applied as a development model for scheduling of the courseware development project in the last case and considered as helpful for the success of the project by the project team members.
2009;a number of studies emphasized the need to capture learners' interaction patterns in order to personalize their learning process as they study through learning objects. in education context learning materials are designed based on pre-determined expectations and learners are evaluated to what extent they master these expectations. representation of these expectations in learning and assessment objects on the other hand is a new challenge for e-learner providers. in order to address this challenge poleonto (personlized ontological learning environment) proposes a new method to separate these expectations by determining domain concepts (conceptnet) and cognitive skills (cogskillnet) for expectations via creating cognitive skill and concept ontology for k-12 education. in this paper we report only the development and design processes of cogskillnet within poleonto environment and we further discuss how cogskillnet can be modeled in the e-learning domain. we also describe how ontological representations play a role in creating personalized navigational guidance for allowing visualization of cognitive skills and providing useful navigational feedback to learners.
2009;in this study a model and software package called webcoach which operates as a learning content management system (lcms) has been developed. it is a web based tutoring system that uses knowledge management techniques to convert the tacit knowledge of experienced lecturers and experts into explicit knowledge. the instructional contents quizzes and assessments glossary of terms for information security course were prepared compiled and organized by this tutoring system. they can be used and reused as learning objects to support learning. webcoach fulfils the requirements for e-learning standards. it has been applied at istanbul commerce university within the information security course. course grades and student questionnaires for two groups of undergraduate computer engineering students were analysed in the course of this study. the control group did not have access of webcoach while the same course was taught via webcoach to the experimental group. the teaching methodology of the control group was based on a classical narrative model. it was observed that the students using webcoach achieved better results compared with the control group students for example 86% of the students were satisfied with the webcoach system.
2009;distance education is used for teacher training at different levels and fields in turkey. launched in the 2000-01 academic year and still applied by anadolu university the preschool teacher training program is one of those programs offered by distance education. this study aims to evaluate anadolu university's preschool teacher training program in turkey by obtaining student opinions. a total of 1026 senior students enrolled in the preschool education major at the open education faculty of anadolu university participated in the survey. a questionnaire to determine the opinions of students about the program was used as a means of data collection. means (x) and standard deviations (sd) were employed to analyze the survey data. the results showed that although the teacher candidates study at a good level they do not have a good record of watching the television programs. the results also revealed that the opinions of teacher candidates about the textbooks television programs teaching practices and academic assistance services are positive.
2009;the international literature provides little in-depth analysis of distance education and e-learning activities achievements and challenges in turkish higher education other than the country's mega-university anadolu. this paper examines the development of and lessons to be learned from such undertakings by three pioneers - two regular state universities ankara university and sakarya university and the private non-profit turkish-kazakhstan ahmet yesevi university. drawing on the collective experience of the authors the paper reaches some overall conclusions about embarking on distance education and e-learning which may apply in other turkish universities and similar economies.
2009;the main purpose of the study is to investigate turkish undergraduate students' perceptions of the web as a learning tool and to analyze whether their perceptions differ significantly based on gender socio-economic background and web experience. data obtained from 722 undergraduate students (331 males and 391 females) were used in the analyses. the findings indicated significant differences based on gender socio-economic background and web experience. the students from higher socio-economic backgrounds indicated significantly higher attitude scores on the self-efficacy subscale of the web attitude scale. similarly the male students indicated significantly higher scores on the self-efficacy subscale than the females. also the students with higher web experience in terms of usage frequency indicated higher scores on all subscales (i.e. self-efficacy affective usefulness web-based learning). moreover the two-way anova results indicated that the student's pc ownership has significant main effects on their web attitudes and on the usefulness self-efficacy and affective subscales.
2009;this study aimed to investigate the underlying components constituting the extended version of the ict indicators measurement scale (ictims) which was developed in 2007 and extended in the current study through the addition of 34 items. new items addressing successful ict integration at education faculties were identified through the examination of the recent literature and expert panels. the tool was administered to 2515 senior students in six education faculties in turkey which were randomly selected from hierarchically ordered clusters. the exploratory factor analysis eliminated 14 of 75 questions in the scale and identified 11 factors accounting for 64.02% of the total variance. the internal consistency coefficient was also high (alpha = .956). factors extracted were e-learning infrastructure teaching-learning methods policy special education health learning communities ease of use e-interaction technical assistance and access. interrelationships among factors were provided along with implications and suggestions for further research.
2009;in like manner as conventional education and teaching approaches distance education tends to model the same procedures. indeed formerly enriched on printed material served as a primary source. however thanks to the developments in technology and evolution in education computerised information has made inroads in distance education programmes. moreover the radio and television also are fullfil the need of this particular program. at anadolu university's open education faculty's tv production centers (educational tv-etv) programs are produced consistent with the faculties adapted open education system. since 1982 more than 5000 educational programs have been produced at the center. in this study the views of employees at anadolu university's open education faculty's tv production center's organizational commitment level are analysed according to affective continuance normative commitment perspectives within the framework of meyer and allen model. in this study an account of the tv production center is provided. employee's commitment levels are also taken into consideration. needless to say that to maintain higher success in practices commitment to organization is very important. hence to assess the level of commitment to the organization surveys were distributed to employees. the organizational commitment scale provided by meyr and allen was also implemented to monitor the results. in the study organizational commitment within affective commitment continuance commitment and normative commitment is analyzed. the survey was applied to 134 employees of tv production center and also face-to-face interviews were conducted. in the second stage spss program was used for necessary analyses according to the demographics of employees (gender age and marital status number of children working duration working unit title and education) frequency test t-test and anova test were applied.
2009;the purpose of this study is to identify the viewpoints of the candidates of physical education and sports teachers and sports managers and to examine these viewpoints with respect to sex class accommodation of the family monthly income of the family computer and internet facilities. survey method was used to carry out the study. the sample of the study consisted of the students attending department of physical education and sports at educational faculty and sports management department of physical education and sports high school in sakarya university. in order to gather data a questionnaire was developed by the researcher and it was applied to 330 students. several statistical techniques such as frequency percentage t-test and anova were used to analyze the data depending on the qualities of the variables. the results of the study indicated that the students think that by the implementation of distance education global education and equality of opportunity would be succeeded. they also think they should have general skills about computer hardware software and internet usage in order to take the advantage of distance education. according to the students providing distance education in practical lessons of the physical education field is almost impossible because the compensation of the failures in physical movements on time is not possible by distance education.

2010;many countries around the world install mullions of computers. printers projectors smartboards and similar technologies in primary and secondary schools to equip new generations with the ability to effectively access and critically evaluate information and communication technologies. however experiences from different countries show that technology does not deliver educational success itself. there are some chronic problems hindering the effective use of educational technology this article aims to identify reasons behind the repetitive problems which occur in the context of turkey's e-learning efforts in primary and secondary learning. the focus is to find out why an organization repeats the same mistakes and has to reinvent the wheel in similar consecutive projects. this study has a qualitative design - more specifically phenomenological design. the main data collection tools were semi-structured interviews with turkey's ministry of national education (mone) authorities academics employees and consultants as well as document analysis qualitative data were collected from these figures via face-to-face interviews so as to understand the experiences and perceptions of those involved in large projects and to gain their interpretative descriptions of their experiences findings showed that mone could not capture. organize disseminate or reuse the knowledge and experiences gained during the project life cycles in short it could not keep its organizational memory which will be useful to guide the managers of future projects (c) 2009 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved
2010;in recent years number of web-based distance education systems has rapidly increased as a result of improvements in the internet. universities have an important role in this situation. having substantial infrastructures in point of accessing the internet permanent education staff and system design team has made distance education more attractive for universities. distance education systems have begun to make their education activities by using tools and services such as electronic books electronic mails and conference calls. with the increasing number of these methods and by developing them consistently the structure that covers the whole system was named the web-based distance education system (wbdes). although there are many data and information about these systems there is no detailed information about the software-preparing process and obtained experiences. in this study a universal wbdes that can be used by all distance education entities has been designed. this wbdes is compatible with any institution or organisation and suitable for universal scorm standards. it includes many features and functions such as student account creation user roles lessons examinations security applications student affairs counselling services internal communication executive functions and assessment etc. with designed systems a software infrastructure that is necessary for a virtual academic institution is provided. the system is currently used in afyon kocatepe university. while designing the system ms sql server 2005 asp. net and c#.net programming languages were used for the database web interfaces and programming respectively. studies and experiments in designing the system were explained in detail.
2010;this study examines one of the design principles of multimedia learning in a context dissimilar to the one in which it was originally tested. personalization principle states that the amount of learning increases when the style of language is informal and conversational. in an attempt to uncover the relationship between learning and language styles with varying degrees of personalization and formality 89 college students were tested with computerized instructional content composed in 1 of the 3 styles: personalized informal personalized formal and neutral formal. the materials consisted of a short text on stellar death with illustrative pictures and animation. the visuals and text were identical for all groups except for additional expressions for personalization and minimal structural changes to evoke a conversational style in 2 of the testing conditions. after reading in i of the 3 conditions the participants were asked retention and transfer questions. the participants also rated the computer program for interest difficulty of the material and their motivation for its style. the findings were generally consistent with the predictions of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning except for the effect size for retention. implications for multimedia design guidelines in varied educational and linguistic contexts are discussed.
2010;the aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions of elementary-level english language learners towards web-based multimedia-annotated grammar learning. webgram a system designed to provide supplementary web-based grammar revision material uses audio-visual aids to enrich the contextual presentation of grammar and allows learners to revise target grammatical structures using interactive exercises such as gap-filling combo-box and drag-and-drop exercises. this study gathered quantitative data on learner satisfaction attention and participation and qualitative data with regard to the material's content visual and instructional design usability practicality and effectiveness. the findings indicate that learners enjoyed using the material and developed a positive attitude towards the system.
2010;in case of insufficient data samples in high-dimensional classification problems sparse scatters of samples tend to have many 'holes'-regions that have few or no nearby training samples from the class. when such regions lie close to inter-class boundaries the nearest neighbors of a query may lie in the wrong class thus leading to errors in the nearest neighbor classification rule. the k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (hknn) algorithm tackles this problem by approximating each class with a smooth nonlinear manifold which is considered to be locally linear. the method takes advantage of the local linearity assumption by using the distances from a query sample to the affine hulls of query's nearest neighbors for decision making. however hknn is limited to using the euclidean distance metric which is a significant limitation in practice. in this paper we reformulate hknn in terms of subspaces and propose a variant the local discriminative common vector (ldcv) method that is more suitable for classification tasks where the classes have similar intra-class variations. we then extend both methods to the nonlinear case by mapping the nearest neighbors into a higher-dimensional space where the linear manifolds are constructed. this procedure allows us to use a wide variety of distance functions in the process while computing distances between the query sample and the nonlinear manifolds remains straightforward owing to the linear nature of the manifolds in the mapped space. we tested the proposed methods on several classification tasks obtaining better results than both the support vector machines (svms) and their local counterpart svm-knn on the usps and image segmentation databases and outperforming the local svm-knn on the caltech visual recognition database.
2010;recent developments and new directions in education have emphasised learners' needs profile and pedagogical aspects by focusing on learner-centered approaches in educational settings. e-learning on the other hand guarantees learners the opportunity of learning in their own way and leads to new considerations in course design. e-learning is defined as the new form of learning rather than the use of new technologies. it requires new considerations in educational aspects and delivery methods. personalised technologies and new approaches such as the use of ontologies and semantic webs in e-learning are some of the next challenges for both education and society in the future. this paper provides an overview and rationale for personalised web-based learning and personalised technologies. also it presents ontologies by emphasising the various usages of this term in a variety of fields the main ontology structures methodologies and design principles and its applications in education.
2010;it is common knowledge that attention is important for learning. we need to utilize attention in order to learn something efficiently and effectively. similarly we may also need to acquire familiarity with (i.e. learn) our surroundings in order to utilize our attention. in this study learning is defined as a product of one's exposure to natural visual stimuli. using a virtual model of a natural scene we investigate both attention and its relationship to learning according to this definition. specifically our focus is the effect of environment familiarity on gaze direction. our findings reveal that the factor of familiarity with one's surroundings in virtual reality environments exerts a significant influence on peoples' ability to detect a variety of specific changes that occur within scenes under their observation.

2013;this paper describes how interactive videoconference can benefit the electrocardiography (ecg) skills of undergraduate nursing students. we have implemented a learning system that interactively transfers the visual and practical aspects of ecg from a nursing skills lab into a classroom where the theoretical part of the course is taught. the students and the instructor in the classroom observe the activities in the skill lab in real time while communicating with the nurse in the lab via audio and video links. an experiment was performed with the participation of 13 male and 57 female (total 70) second year nursing students-36 of who were assigned to videoconference group (experimental group-vcg) and the other 34 were assigned to traditional classroom groups (control group-tcg). in the experiment ecg knowledge levels of participants were measured by repeated tests (pretest posttest i and posttest ii) and data were analyzed with repeated measures of variances and covariance the results demonstrating that videoconferencing contributed significantly to the improvement of ecg skills of the participants. in addition a questionnaire was given to students along with posttest ii and the result of which indicated overwhelming satisfaction with videoconference based lecture.
2013;aims: a basic knowledge and understanding of first aid can be invaluable for both teachers and students to be able to provide emergency care in the event of an accident possibly saving lives and minimizing injury in school settings. the purpose of this research was to perform a comparison of online and face-to-face delivery modes for an introductory first aid course to determine if there existed a difference in student teachers' success depending on the delivery modes. methods: the research compares participants' achievements in a first aid class taught by the same instructor using either face-to-face or online delivery modes. in total five sections of the course were assigned to either a face-to face or an online treatment condition. results: the results of a paired samples t-test indicated that student teachers both in experiment and control groups performed adequately to attain the course goals (p < .05). the difference between the mean scores of all groups in pre- and post-tests verified the achievement of the participant learners. the results of a further independent t-test on groups' performances on the post application of the achievement test showed a significant variance in favour of participants who received online teaching (p < .05). conclusion: the findings of the study suggest that while both online and face-to-face mode can be effective in achieving learning goals of first aid content online learning was found to be more effective in comparison to traditional classroom instruction.
2013;background: although advances in distance learning have shown signs of a reconfiguration of the teacher's role in online environments a large number of online teaching practices still do not show many signs of this shift. given the need for a change in pedagogies investigating how exemplary teachers transfer their thinking pedagogical knowledge and beliefs to successful online teaching is critical to understanding new online learning and teaching practices. the research on online teacher roles and practices however has been limited in terms of bringing teachers' voices into the research process and empowering them as autonomous professionals who constantly engage in a dialogue about solving complex problems and making decisions about online teaching. purpose and research questions: the purpose of this research was to look at exemplary online teachers' transition to online teaching with a focus on their successful practices. the research investigated two central questions: (1) what are the successful practices that exemplary online teachers employ in their online teaching? (2) how do exemplary online teachers make a transition to online teaching in such a way that they create successful practices? research design: the study followed a qualitative multiple-case study approach examining six different cases of exemplary online teachers and their teaching contexts within a large research university in the midwestern united states. using multiple cases allowed for comparison of similar and contrasting online teaching situations and conditions within the university's different colleges. participants data collection and analysis: the data sources of the study consisted of (1) semistructured interviews conducted with six online program coordinators to collect contextual information and gather nominations for successful online teachers in each college and (2) ethnographic interviews conducted with 6 online teachers nominated as exemplary to gather teacher-expressed needs knowledge and successful practices. within-and cross-case analyses were conducted to generate codes and identify the similarities and differences across the cases as well as common themes. conclusions/recommendations: the findings of this study indicated that when teachers described their successful practices they often linked them to their changing roles and new representation of their selves within an online environment. their portrayal of the teacher self both built on a plethora of previous experiences and reformed with the affordances and limitations of the online environment went through a process whereby teachers were constantly challenged to make themselves heard known and felt by their students. this study showed that it was critical to listen to teachers' voices and give them a participatory role in the creation and use of their knowledge and experience in order to form their online teacher personas. as a result programs that prepare faculty to teach online may need to encourage teachers to reflect on their past experiences assumptions and beliefs toward learning and teaching and transform their perspectives by engaging in pedagogical inquiry and problem solving.
2013;problem statement: teaching a language with the help of comput ers and the internet has attracted the attention of many practitioners and researchers in the last 20 years so the number of studies that investigate whether computers and the internet promote language learning continues to increase. these studies have focused on exploring the beliefs and attitudes of learners and teachers towards computers and the internet or on inquiring whether computers and the internet increase the achievement levels of learners or enhance students' awareness of other cultures. despite the widespread use of computers and the internet in educational settings a small number of research studies have investigated the role of computer-assisted language learning (call) in promoting learner autonomy. this study will contribute to the literature on the ways that call environments foster learner autonomy. purpose: the aim of this study is to utilize language learning environments equipped with technology to develop learner autonomy. there are four behavioural indicators of autonomy: using language learning strategies a high motivation level to learn the english language taking responsibility for one's own learning and continued english language study outside the classroom. method: forty-eight intermediate-level students at a private university in ankara turkey participated in this study. the students were divided into two groups: the strategy training group (stg) and the non-strategy training group (nstg). the students in the stg received a five-week language learning strategy training through call while the participants in the nstg followed the university's regular curriculum. data were collected by means of questionnaires semi-structured face-to-face interviews classroom observations e-learning diaries and the five-week language learning strategy training through call. findings and results: the results of the study indicate that the students in the stg displayed improvement in their usage of language learning strategies had higher motivation were more willing to take responsibility for their own learning and were engaged in extra-curricular study by means of call compared to the students in the nstg. conclusions and recommendations: becoming autonomous learners necessitates readiness on the part of the students. therefore it is important for instructors to know whether their students are ready to develop autonomy. autonomous learning differs from conventional foreign language education in the sense that the primary focus of autonomous learning is on the learners' individual awareness of the learning process. therefore it would be beneficial for curriculum units in language teaching institutions to revise course objectives and to design classroom activities that promote learner autonomy.

2014;we introduce a new algorithm for distance metric learning which uses pairwise similarity (equivalence) and dissimilarity constraints. the method is adapted to the high-dimensional feature spaces that occur in many computer vision applications. it first projects the data onto the subspace orthogonal to the linear span of the difference vectors of similar sample pairs. similar samples thus have identical projections i.e. the distance between the two elements of each similar sample pair becomes zero in the projected space. in the projected space we find a linear embedding that maximizes the scatter of the dissimilar sample pairs. this corresponds to a pseudo-metric characterized by a positive semi-definite matrix in the original input space. we also kernelize the method and show that this allows it to handle cases with low-dimensional input spaces and large numbers of similarity constraints. despite the method's simplicity experiments on synthetic problems and on real-world image retrieval visual object classification gender classification and image segmentation ones demonstrate its effectiveness yielding significant improvements over the existing distance metric learning methods.

2015;objective e-learning is a candidate tool for clinical practice guidelines (cpg) implementation due to its versatility universal access and low costs. we aimed to assess the impact of a five-module e-learning course about cpg for acute gastroenteritis (age) on physicians' knowledge and clinical practice. study design this work was conceived as a pre/post single-arm intervention study. physicians from 11 european countries registered for the online course. personal data pre- and post-course questionnaires and clinical data about 3 to 5 children with age managed by each physician before and after the course were collected. primary outcome measures included the proportion of participants fully adherent to cpg and number of patients managed with full adherence. results among the 149 physicians who signed up for the e-learning course 59 took the course and reported on their case management of 519 children <5 years of age who were referred to their practice because of age (281 and 264 children seen before and after the course respectively). the course improved knowledge scores (pre-course 8.6 +/- 2.7 versus post-course 12.8 +/- 2.1 p < 0.001) average adherence (from 87.0 +/- 7.7% to 90.6 +/- 7.1% p = 0.001) and the number of patients managed in full adherence with the guidelines (from 33.6 +/- 31.7% to 43.9 +/- 36.1% p = 0.037). conclusions e-learning is effective in increasing knowledge and improving clinical practice in paediatric age and is an effective tool for implementing clinical practice guidelines.
2015;ontologies have often been recommended for e-learning systems but few efforts have successfully incorporated student data to represent knowledge conceptualizations. defining key concepts and their relations between each other establishes the backbone of our e-learning system. the system guides an individual student through his/her course by evaluating their progress and suggesting instructional material to review based upon their answers. three main tasks are performed within this framework: building ontologies for the course measuring a student's understanding level for the concepts and making personal suggestions to create an individualized learning environment. this paper presents: the integration of ontologies assisted with student data together with an intelligent recommendation module for the development of an e-learning system the comparison and correction adaption of ontology from students' mind maps and the assessment of students' actual weaknesses in comparison to what recommendation module suggests. the sample of 127 students five classrooms was conveniently selected among seventh grade students of a demographically average school in a major city in turkey. the students' achievement was assessed and the scores for different questions were investigated for associations with concepts made in the students' minds. the results provided significant correlations among scores and a fit model for the concepts represented by questions. the student suggested model slightly differed from the ontology map from the experts. based on the data-supported model the recommendation module more accurately determined the students' learning deficiencies and suggested concepts to be reviewed.
2015;due to lack of infrastructure staff and finance rural people in developing countries generally have limited formal education and especially limited access to rural education services. however agricultural innovations are constantly changing and rural people should be informed of these developments thus distance education can be one of the ideal solutions to reach rural areas. this paper discusses the importance and limitations of distance education through television in developing countries and presents the turkish experience. the experiences of rural distance education projects in developing countries revealed that use of multiple agricultural extension methods together such as television programs printed materials group discussions and field demonstrations is more effective in changing rural people's attitudes towards agricultural innovations. motivational factors such as prizes and giving certificates are also effective. after the projects further agricultural television programs and manuals can also be used to support the project.
2015;the aim of this research is to determine the effect of a web-based learning atmosphere on the students' academic achievements and the level of self-esteem. the research was planned according to an experimental design with an initial-final test controlled group. fifty-two students who have physical education in a and b classes of the 7th grade in kirsehir m. husnu ozyegin primary school formed this research's study group. the data of the research was collected by using a volleyball academic achievement test which was improved by the researcher and the cooper smith self-esteem inventory. the results show that web-supported teaching provide benefits to the students cognitive academic achievement in the field of volleyball according to traditional teaching but it was seen that there is no meaningful difference in their self-esteem as statistics.
2015;the aim of this mixed method study is to identify evaluation criteria for interactive e-books. to find answers for the research questions of the study both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a four-round delphi study with a panel consisting of 30 experts. after that a total of 20 interactive e-books were examined with heuristic inquiry methodology. in the final phase the results of the delphi technique and the heuristic inquiry results were integrated. as a result four themes 15 dimensions and 37 criteria were developed for interactive e-books. lastly the results and their implications are discussed in this paper and suggestions for further research are presented.
2015;massive open online courses (moocs) came to prominence with open educational resources movement (oerm). it was based upon the idea of libre in removal of some permission barriers and gratis in removing the price barrier (suber 2008) in learning resources. in line with the theoretical underpinnings of oerm moocs embody primary characteristics of connectivist pedagogy which are autonomy diversity openness and community participation. however in time moving away from its original philosophical and pedagogical values new variations of moocs have emerged and new moocs have become more market oriented and are aligned with instructivist cognitive and behaviourist pedagogy. in an attempt to empirically examine the change in underlying values of the moocs a survey method was employed by using a connectivist learning environment assessment tool which was developed in the scope of this research. the tool could be useful for formulating and justifying a conceptual framework that enables us to reify the connectivist pedagogy and assess connectivist underpinnings of a learning environment including moocs. this research aims to contribute to mooc studies against the background of previous knowledge from the open education and connectivist fields.
2015;in this study a scale-invariant representation for closed planar curves (silhouettes) is proposed. the orientations of all points within the gaussian scale-space of the curve are extracted. this orientation scale-space is used to create the silhouette orientation image in which the positions of each pixel indicate the curve's pixel positions and scales whereas the colour represents orientation. the representation is extracted for multiple levels of the morphological scale-space of the silhouette. the proposed representation is invariant to scale and transformable under planar rotation. using linear and non-linear distance learning methods experiments on the mpeg7 eth80 and kimia shape datasets were conducted with results indicating an advanced recognition capability.
2015;much of the literature and the academic discussion about institutional strategic planning of massive open online courses (mooc) has been centred on the u.s. context. literature on moocs in europe is still developing and just recently some empirical studies were conducted. however these studies are not comparable and it is hard to learn about differences between regions and types of educational institutions. given the very different institutional political and cultural contexts it is interesting to analyse how in these two different regions higher education institutions (heis) are responding to the challenges of the mooc phenomena and are integrating it in their own strategic planning. the current research presents the first attempt to conduct a comparative study of institutional mooc strategies in europe and u.s. it is based on a survey launched by the eu-funded home project and compares results with a similar survey conducted in u.s. results show that there are significant differences in how the u.s. and european heis understand the impact of massive open education and also how they perceive the efficiency of digital education and online learning.
2015;several unmet needs have been identified in allergic rhinitis: identification of the time of onset of the pollen season optimal control of rhinitis and comorbidities patient stratification multidisciplinary team for integrated care pathways innovation in clinical trials and above all patient empowerment. mask-rhinitis (macvia-aria sentinel network for allergic rhinitis) is a simple system centred around the patient which was devised to fill many of these gaps using information and communications technology (ict) tools and a clinical decision support system (cdss) based on the most widely used guideline in allergic rhinitis and its asthma comorbidity (aria 2015 revision). it is one of the implementation systems of action plan b3 of the european innovation partnership on active and healthy ageing (eip on aha). three tools are used for the electronic monitoring of allergic diseases: a cell phone-based daily visual analogue scale (vas) assessment of disease control carat (control of allergic rhinitis and asthma test) and e-allergy screening (premedical system of early diagnosis of allergy and asthma based on online tools). these tools are combined with a clinical decision support system (cdss) and are available in many languages. an e-crf and an e-learning tool complete mask. mask is flexible and other tools can be added. it appears to be an advanced global and integrated ict answer for many unmet needs in allergic diseases which will improve policies and standards.
2015;the massive open online course (mooc) movement is the latest big thing in open and distance learning (odl). moocs offer both opportunities and threats that are extensively discussed in the literature including the potential of opening up education for all at a global scale. on the other hand moocs challenge traditional pedagogy and raise important questions about the future of campus-based education. however in discussing these opportunities and threats the majority of the literature tends to focus on the origin of the mooc movement in the united states (us). the specific context of europe with its diversity of languages cultural environments educational policies and regulatory frameworks differs substantially from the us context. accordingly this article offers a european perspective on moocs in order to better understand major differences in threats and opportunities across countries and continents including the use and reuse of moocs for regional or global use via european or non-european platforms. in the context of the eu funded home project (higher education online: moocs the european way) a research initiative was undertaken to identify opportunities and threats of the mooc movement for european higher education institutions. three sources of data were gathered and analysed. opportunities and threats were categorized into two levels. the macro level comprises issues related to the higher education system european context historical period and institutional concerns. the micro level covers aspects related to faculty teachers and courses thus to the operational level. the main opportunities discovered were: the ects as a robust system for formal recognition of accomplishments in moocs the trend for institutional collaboration stimulated by eu-funded programs and the many innovative and alternative pedagogical models used in moocs published in europe. the main threats mentioned were: implementation problems of the ects difficulties in bridging non/informal and formal education and too much regulation hindering experimentation and innovation.
2015;the trend of using e-learning systems is now rapidly expanding into all educational domains. although they are popular research studies have been focused on the e-learners and undergraduate levels. instructors play an important role in specifying the effectivity success or inefficacy and adoption of the e-learning systems so predicting instructors' behavioral intention to use learning management system is essential prior to its adoption. the purpose of this study is to explore instructors' behavioral intention to use learning management system (lms) at a postsecondary military vocational college level. we used a conceptual framework proposed by findik coskuncay and ozkan for understanding vocational college instructors' behavioral intention to use lms. framework includes the core constructs in technology acceptance model: namely perceived ease of use perceived usefulness behavioral intention and application self-efficacy technological complexity subjective norm. additional external variables were also adopted namely instructors' age prior teaching experience and course relevance. accordingly 115 instructors are asked to answer the questionnaire for investigating behavioral intention. after statistical analysis the results demonstrate that all mentioned variables either directly or indirectly affect the overall behavioral intention to use lms. instructors' perceived usefulness was found as the most significant factor for predicting instructors' behavioral intention to use lms. instructors' age did not correlate significantly with the factors in technology acceptance model and there was negative significant correlation between instructors' teaching experience and technological complexity subjective norm and behavioral intention.

2016;we propose a two-layer decision fusion technique called fuzzy stacked generalization (fsg) which establishes a hierarchical distance learning architecture. at the base-layer of an fsg fuzzy k-nn classifiers receive different feature sets each of which is extracted from the same dataset to gain multiple views of the dataset at the meta-layer first a fusion space is constructed by aggregating decision spaces of all the base-layer classifiers. then a fuzzy k-nn classifier is trained in the fusion space by minimizing the difference between the large sample and n-sample classification error. in order to measure the degree of collaboration among the base-layer classifiers and the diversity of the feature spaces a new measure called shareability is introduced. shearability is defined as the number of samples that are correctly classified by at least one of the base-layer classifiers in fsg. in the experiments we observe that fsg performs better than the popular distance learning and ensemble learning algorithms when the shareability measure is large enough such that most of the samples are correctly classified by at least one of the base-layer classifiers. the relationship between the proposed and state-of-the-art diversity measures is experimentally analyzed. the tests performed on a variety of artificial and real-world benchmark datasets show that the classification performance of fsg increases compared to that of state-of-the art ensemble learning and distance learning methods as the number of classes increases.

2017;distance education is an important research subject in turkey like it is in the world and there are many master's and doctoral theses exist that deal with distance education. the aim of this study is to reveal current research trends in distance education theses published in turkey between 2005 and 2014. in this 'direction 380theses that are open to access on the council of higher education (cohe) national theses database were reviewed. the theses were entered by using distance education theses examination form (detef) which contains thesis type thesis subject publication year university institute department research method research design sampling method sample population data collecting tool and data analysis. the method sections of the theses were analyzed with descriptive content analysis. the results indicated that while the number of theses in the field of distance education were on the rise until 2010 the number of thesis started to decrease within following years. in addition it was determined that institutes employ different research methodologies. another result is that the most used research design is survey in quantitative methodology theses case studies in qualitative and mixed methodology theses. it was determined that the sampling method is not expressed in most of the theses based on the quantitative methodology. on the other hand purposeful sampling is most used in theses based on the qualitative methodology. the most commonly studied sample population were undergraduate students and adults for all methodologies. with regard to the data collecting tools used in the distance education theses surveys and scales are mostly used in the quantitative methodology while the interview method is mostly used in the theses based on the qualitative methodology. besides it was determined that basic statistical techniques were used in distance education theses. from this results in order to conduct more scientific and qualified studies related to distance education all research methodologies which are not adequately and effectively used as the findings show should be encouraged.
2017;lifelong learning can be defined as all of the activities which aim to develop an individual's skills knowledge and abilities socially individually and professionally. previous research on lifelong learning has been about using computers digital competence and the correlation between demographic characteristics and intelligence. however only one scale was used in this research and in general only scores for demographic characteristics and lifelong learning were compared. in this research the correlation between distance-learning students' attitudes to technology their frequency of use of smartphones and their attitudes to lifelong learning were examined. reliability studies were carried out prior to the study and the turkish adaptations of the scales published in international journals were administered with permission. the study sample consisted of 881 students studying in 12 different units of hitit university: six vocational schools four faculties and two graduate schools. the data were analysed by creating a structural equation model on the open source r analysis program. according to the research results there was a significant correlation between the three scales and the correlation between the 'lifelong learning' scores and the 'frequency of of smartphone usage' scores was greater than the 'technology attitudes' scores.
2017;with its total number of users (around 62 million) throughout the world it is important to determine the views of academics who use edmodo (the leading sln. in this respect in the first part of this two-part research the purpose was to examine academics' (n=50) use of technology and social networks. as for the purpose of the second part it was to determine the views of 12 academics selected from the academics participating in the first part who had experience in edmodo about the basic features of edmodo and about its use in education. in the study carried out with the mixed method the qualitative and quantitative data were collected with an online questionnaire. the findings obtained were interpreted within the framework of cooperative learning and the theories of diffusion of innovations and uses and gratifications and the related themes were formed. as a result the academics with experience in edmodo reported their views about the benefits of use of the edmodo in education. regarding the differences between edmodo and social networks the results suggested that the former was used completely for educational purposes and that it did not involve any unnecessary components.
2017;teaching in the field of public health needs to employ a global perspective to account for the fact that public health problems and solutions have global determinants and implications as well. international university partnerships can promote such a perspective through the strengthening of cooperation exchange and communication between academic institutions across national boundaries. as an example for such an academic network in the field of public health we introduce the international public health partnership-a collaboration between a university in germany and universities in india turkey and nigeria. formed in 2005 it facilitated the exchange of information fostered discussion about the transferability of public health concepts contributed to the structural development of the universities involved and promoted an intercultural dialog through a combination of local and distance learning activities. although well accepted by students and staff different obstacles were encountered these included limited external funding scarce own financial time and personnel resources and diverging regulations and structures of degree programs at the partnership sites. in the present article we share several lessons that we learned during our joint collaboration and provide recommendations for other universities that are involved in partnerships with institutions of higher education or are interested to initiate such collaborations.
2017;achievement goal theory is an important framework to understand students' achievement goals motivation and engagement in academic situations and to study teachers' instructional practices. there has been a debate about whether optimal motivation involves the pursuit of mastery goals only (i.e. mastery goal perspective) or the combined pursuit of mastery and performance-approach goals (i.e. multiple goal perspective barron & harackiewicz 2001 2003). in the present correlational research we tested these two goal perspectives in two peruvian samples of high school students (sample 1: n = 1505 sample 2: n = 551) and further examined whether students in classes in which teachers were perceived to promote mastery goals only or performance-approach goals would display the most optimal learning pattern. after controlling for learners' performance-avoidance goal pursuit results provided only slim evidence for the additive goal perspective as the effects of students' pursuit of mastery goals were more robust and consistent across both samples and outcomes (i.e. learning strategies and math grades). along similar lines at the class level perceived teacher-promoted mastery goals positively predicted deep-level learning strategies while class-level perceived teacher-promoted performance-avoidance goals related to lower academic achievement.

2017;the aim of this study is to reveal open education related social media usage in turkey through social network analyses. to this end the most widely used social media network in turkey facebook was chosen. all the pages and groups created on facebook related to open education were found. a total of 207 groups and 521 pages were accessed and entered into the social network analysis. within the scope of this study the density and centrality features of the network were analyzed for groups whereas the density centrality and degrees features of the network were analyzed for pages. the study's results revealed that while pages and groups related to programs emphasizing current job opportunities and student support services were more actively used commercial accounts attempted to exploit students' exam anxiety instead of generating actual content. the findings also revealed that well structured institutional pages appeal to students and have the potential to reach high levels of popular in short periods of time.
2017;the present study aimed to investigate the efficiency level of digital teaching materials for higher education programs. the present study had a mixed research methodology to gather in-depth and rich context. twenty participants were chosen from a distance education program of the pedagogical formation (2014-2015) at near east university in nicosia in north cyprus. the sample of the present study was selected by using the purposeful sampling method. the participants who took the course (instructional technology and material design) half of them used electronic sources and the other half used traditional sources during the distance education. the participants' answers were categorized into who was taking distance education with digital materials and who was taking distance education with non-digital materials. the results indicate that the participants were aware of the facilities of using e-books and they were content with the facilities of using an electronic book. the participants' view show that using electronic book has function on being successful and interactive in their education. at the same time using electronic book provide chances to students reach multiple sources. thus the participants' answers in qualitative data also indicate that using multimedia is necessity to increase level of motivation students in their study and using electronic book and electronic sources provide unlimited learning platforms for students. thus students' level of attention and permanent learning are increased.
2017;to fully understand the phenomenon of massive open online courses (moocs) it is important to identify and map trends and patterns in research on moocs. this study does so by reviewing 362 empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2015. for the purpose of this study content analysis and discourse analysis were employed to analyze the articles. accordingly the trend line showing the number of articles per year indicates that the extent of research on moocs is likely to increase in the coming years. in terms of research areas the findings reveal an imbalance and three research areas out of fifteen constitute more than half of all research on moocs. with regard to types of moocs related literature is dominated by research on xmoocs. the discourse in mooc articles takes a mostly neutral standpoint articles with a positive outlook outweigh those that are negative and there is an increase in a more critical discourse. theoretical or conceptual studies are preferred by researchers although mooc research generally does not benefit from being viewed through theoretical or conceptual lenses.
2017;social media is a web 2.0 platform that allows to share content and information without the limitations of time and space. social media networks have managed to become a part of today's lifestyle and are increasingly gaining importance when viewed from a state perspective. sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. in this study we focus on social media mining and sentiment analysis for students of an open and distance education system. anadolu university which has approximately two million students and more than two million graduates is a well-known institution in turkey that offers higher education through contemporary distance education model. firstly we have fetched tweets related to anadolu university open and distance education system. to perform sentiment analysis these tweets were analysed by statistical and data mining techniques. finally results were visualized.
2017;the educational timetabling problem has been extensively investigated in timetabling literature. however the problem of assigning exams to examination buildings has not been studied intensively by researchers. we were inspired by open and distance education system exams of anadolu university. anadolu university open and distance education system which is used by approximately two millions of students and has more than two millions of graduates is a well-known institution in turkey. in this study we propose a multi-objective mathematical model for multisession exam-building assignment problem. objective functions of this model are to minimize the distance between consecutive session buildings for a given student to maximize the number of occupants of buildings in every session and to minimize the variety of booklets for building in every session. mathematical model has been found inadequate because students-examination building assignment in the anadolu university open education system is a large size real life problem. starting from this point of view an order-based multi-objective heuristic algorithm is developed to solve this problem. the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with the solution obtained by the mathematical modelling and the current state of the existing system.
2017;provinces that vary by socioeconomic levels in turkey are among the main starting points of planned development. meanwhile one of the most important indicators considered in determining differences in development is education. anadolu university clearly has a very important place in turkey's higher education system with its open and distance education system. therefore we aim in our study to investigate how socioeconomic development affects provincial demand for an open education system. first we perform analyses over 81 provinces. however we thought the demand in istanbul ankara and izmir to have a special place and excluded them to perform analyses over the remaining 78 provinces using the developmental index of 2012. we evaluated 48 different regression models statistically and using four different regression techniques created these models by dividing them into four classes: linear nonparametric generalized linear and generalized nonparametric. the relations in the models between education and development are examined not only as a parametric and linear relationship but also as a nonparametric and nonlinear relationship. we found a positive nonparametric and nonlinear relationship for the demand for the open and distance education system with the provincial socioeconomic developmental levels.
2017;the aim of this study was to study the effect of web-based teaching video packages on medical students' satisfaction during gross anatomy education. the objective was to test the hypothesis that individual preference which can be related to learning style influences individual utilization of the video packages developed specifically for the undergraduate medical curriculum. web-based teaching video packages consisting of closed circuit audiovisual system and distance education of anatomy were prepared. 54 informative application videos each lasting an average 12 min competent with learning objectives have been prepared. 300 young adults of the medical school on applied anatomy education were evaluated in terms of their course content exam performance and perceptions. a survey was conducted to determine the difference between the students who did not use teaching packages with those who used it during or after the lecture. a mean of 150 hits for each student per year was indicated. academic performance of anatomy has been an increase of 10 points. positive effects of the video packages on anatomy education have manifested on the survey conducted on students. the survey was compiled under twenty different items including effectiveness providing education opportunity and affecting learning positively. additionally the difference was remarkable that the positive ideas of the second year students on learning were statistically significant from that of the third year students. web-based video packages are helpful definitive easily accessible and affordable which enable students with different pace of learning to reach information simultaneously in equal conditions and increase the learning activity in crowded group lectures in cadaver labs. we conclude that personality/learning preferences of individual students influence their use of video packages in the medical curriculum.
2017;this study proposed a theoretical model explaining causal relationships between student participation and academic achievement through their learning analytics in a web-based distance education course testing it using structural equation modeling (sem) with an empirical dataset. the sample was composed of 167 university students enrolled in the department of computer programming in the distance education vocational school at a major state university in turkey. student participation was operationalized through learning analytics of the number of submissions to discussion forums and attendance to online lectures whereas academic achievement was represented by students' performance on their project assignments and final exam. the results of the sem analysis indicated that the modified version of the model had a good fit with the data (x(2)=2.52 df=1 p>.05 x(2)/df=2.52 gfi=.99 cfi=.99 rmsea=.09 srmr=.03). discussion forum submission and online lecture attendance were found to be positively associated with each other. they had a positive direct effect on students' project scores and a positive indirect effect on students' final exam scores via their project scores. moreover discussion forum submission was found to have a direct positive effect on students' final exam scores. practical implications and suggestions for further research are discussed within the context of online learning.
2017;the rapid development of technology from day to day has manifested itself also in the field of education and therefore it has become compulsory to include new regulations in education. in this fast-paced development technology is coming into prominence both in distance education and traditional education. in this context the technological organization established has an important role in the emergence of success perception. since computer has begun to be used in the field of education in addition to traditional education the distance education has become in a more effective and productive education for foreign language learners. in this study the distance learning traditional education teaching environments and perception of organizing as academic achievement are explained. the study has been carried out in a private university in the academic year of 2016-2017. the aim of this study is to evaluate the perception of success between distance education and traditional education in the foreign language education. this study examined the perceptions of administrators lecturers and students towards the distance learning and traditional learning in order to evaluate the academic success of organizing in foreign language learning. the qualitative data analysis was used in this study. administrators and students reported that they were prepared to facilitate individual study and improve their work skills with distance learning in the foreign language learning but that the lecturers were not in the same position with the administrators and students in distance education.
2017;aircraft maintenance is one of the primary causes or contributing factors in aircraft accidents. it is clear that proper training of aircraft maintenance technicians (amts) will avoid failures reduce maintenance related accidents improve safety and reliability in aviation and provide recovery of the increasing demand to qualified amts for sustainability of the market growth. in this study european safety agency (easa) based amt licencing system in eu states (and non-eu states implementing easa rules) has been analysed and a training model developed in accordance with easa part-66 requirements and delivered by e-learning methods has been introduced. the analysis of the licensing process based on easa regulations showed that this process was based on the candidate's demonstration of knowledge and acquisition of experience. the required experience depends on the training background of the candidate. field exercise showed that developed e-learning training model which overcomes the disadvantages of traditional face to face training models succeeded to improve the attendees' theoretical knowledge level and when combined with the practical trainings given to amt candidates in maintenance organisations during their experience periods will be very successful in improving safety and reliability in aviation maintenance operations.
2018;this study has focused on the factor affecting the exit from farming of young farmers since it is an important issue in many provinces of turkey. data obtained through face-to-face interview method with 85 selected young farmers (aged 15-40 years) engaged in agricultural activity in the nigde province in 2017. logistic regression model based upon the dependent variable decision to exit from farming was used to determine relevant factors. according to results number of children the presence of house in the city center and the monthly income level has effects to exit from farming. young farmers have priorities to reach a better life conditions for their children such as better education and health care services. rural investment support should be increased entrepreneurship and innovation trainings should be expanded by encouraging training on agriculture. it would be beneficial to develop different applications such as distance learning modules and digital agriculture.
2018;this paper presents a review of peer-reviewed publications (2007-2017) on digital open educational practices (oeps). it explores trends and patterns in this emerging area of study by examining paper abstracts and bibliographic data indexed in the scopus database using a combination of descriptive statistics text mining social network analysis and content analysis. findings demonstrated two major strands of oep research: those who discuss oep in the context of open educational resources mostly in terms of open educational resource creation adoption and use and those who discuss oep in relation to other areas including open scholarship open learning open teaching or pedagogy open systems and architectures and open source software. based on the findings of this study and in the light of the broader literature on oeps we echo the calls for a need to conceptualize oeps as a multidimensional and unifying construct.
2018;the purpose of this study is to uncover factors that affect participation in online classes from the student's perspective. interest in the online environment has been increasing and renders the opinions of students participating in online courses more important since the opinions of students in this environment are closely related to interaction. it has been seen that lack of interaction creates a sense of loneliness which causes students to drop their classes. for this reason a qualitative study has been conducted about student experiences on the use of methods that increase interaction in an online environment and participation. participants were given tasks based on collaboration special attention was paid to make sure that the setting in which the participants found themselves was in accordance with the principles of the community of inquiry computerized equipment was used to facilitate online interactions. 15 students worked based on collaboration and 15 students worked individually. data was collected with interviews and reflection reports. open axial and selective coding was made by using the theorizing method. at the end of the study it was determined that participation in online environment was affected in both groups by factors such as personal approaches changing variables mediated attributes.
2018;in this paper the determinants of the intention to use online learning management system (lms) among students in one of universities in the kyrgyz republic were studied using quantitative and qualitative analysis. a total of 541 responses from students enrolled in online courses during the fall and spring semesters 2016-2017 were used to examine students attitude toward online education. in addition interviews with six instructors were conducted. results showed that success of students in e-courses depend on year of education and the academic major of students. factors defined in the scope of this work namely technical characteristics of lms ease of use feedback options of lms and advantages of lms use were also found to be significant for students in their success in online courses. in interviews with instructors three main points were highlighted namely problem with students' perception of online courses lack of online education experience among instructors and administrative issues.
2018;the importance of distance education has increased due to its many advantages. at the same time apart from university education distance education also allows oneself to develop in different subjects. this work examines a distance education study conducted at a university in turkey. the department of industrial engineering was selected for this study. e-learning applications for industrial engineering education are seen to be extremely efficient especially since they do not require laboratory applications. the faculty of engineering which aims to obtain a higher quality education of students who receive industrial engineering training through e-learning has evaluated related software companies in this regard. the infrastructure of the program has been determined as online and recorded broadcasting. web-based training has been carried out by creating wide communication networks. this study explores in detail the necessary requirements for the successful execution of distance education in industrial engineering. in addition it has benefited from the work undertaken in the past in order to determine the assessment factors. these assessment factors consist of five main factors and twenty-four sub-factors. these assessment factors have been established in line with the opinions of the people who constitute the infrastructure of this study. these past evaluations were usually made subjectively. subjective evaluations often cause misinterpretation of results. this study applies both analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (swara) methods both of which are multiple criteria decision-making methods. consistency ratios are calculated to determine whether comparisons are consistent for the ahp method. in addition the ahp method is discussed together with fuzzy logic to make the study more realistic. due to the ease of application and common use triangular fuzzy numbers are preferred as a fuzzy method. the results are validated by the swara method which is used to weight the criteria. the purpose of this study is to weight the assessment factors affecting e-learning technology by using fuzzy ahp and swara methods. thus the study illustrates that multi-criteria decision-making methods can be used in e-learning applications to evaluate many factors.
2018;from the beginning of the e-learning technology era many concerns arose regarding the use of e-learning in everyday academic processes. thus in recent years a number of studies were conducted on e-learning acceptance mostly with the use of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model. current study investigates the determinants of acceptance of academic e-learning technologies with the use of proposed modified utaut model. the basic utaut model was supplemented by the examined new determinants: system interactivity and the area of scientific expertise. therefore the paper contributes to utaut theory applied in e-learning by utilising empirical research with a modified utaut model including these two new variables. this study confirmed the hypotheses related to the effects of performance expectancy effort expectancy and system interactivity on behavioural intention to use e-learning technologies and also stated that the area of scientific expertise does not have a direct impact on the intention to use e-learning technologies. the research model has been tested in an academic environment in turkey.
2018;professional development (pd) is critical for instructors who are adopting new roles and competencies in online teaching environments. this mixed-method study examines an online faculty development programme in turkey reflecting upon participants' expectations readiness and satisfaction. the findings indicate a significant relationship between individual readiness and satisfaction and reveal that readiness positively predicts satisfaction. participants' reflections demonstrate that to enhance their traditional roles they need competencies for online learning environments and active practice in real-life applications. pd is important for introducing the new pedagogies required and for integration of technology while the adoption of new roles is key to developing competent online instructors who have a positive attitude to online learning.
2018;since the first offering of a massive open online course (mooc) in 2008 the body of literature on this new phenomenon of open learning has grown tremendously. in this regard this article intends to identify and map patterns in research on moocs by reviewing 362 empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2015. for the purposes of this study a text-mining tool was used to analyse the content of the published research journal articles and to reveal the major themes and concepts covered in the publications. the findings reveal that the mooc literature generally focuses on four lines of research: (a) the potential and challenges of moocs for universities (b) mooc platforms (c) learners and content in moocs and (d) the quality of moocs and instructional design issues. prospective researchers may use these results to gain an overview of this emerging field as well as to explore potential research directions.
2018;previous studies have described many scales for measuring self-regulation however no scale has been developed specifically for self-paced open and distance learning environments. therefore the aim of this study is to develop a scale for determining the self-regulated learning skills of distance learners in self-paced open and distance learning courses. participants of this study were 1279 distance learners who were part of self-paced distance learning courses in a public open and distance teaching university in turkey. the items of the scale were prepared based on the literature review expert opinions and learner questionnaires. the items of the scale were reduced from 62 to 30 after expert opinions and validity and reliability analyses. for the validity of the scale the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. the total variance was found to be 58.204%. the cronbach's alpha coefficient calculated for the reliability of the scale was found to be.937. five factors composed of goal setting help seeking self-study strategies managing physical environment and effort regulation emerged in the 30-item scale. thus it was concluded that the scale has a high validity and reliability. this scale is intended to help teachers and instructional designers in developing strategies that will enable learners to either enhance their existing self-regulated learning skills or help them to acquire new skills in self-paced open and distance learning environments.
2018;although the number of online academic degree programs offered by universities in turkey has become increasingly significant in recent years the current lack of understanding of administrators' motives that contribute to initiating these programs suggests there is much to be learned in this field. this study aimed to investigate administrators' perceptions of motives for offering online academic degree programs in universities in turkey in terms of online associate degree programs online master's degree programs online bachelor's degree completion programs and online bachelor's degree programs. a qualitative research method was employed for this study. semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 administrators from different universities' distance education centers in turkey and thematic analysis was applied to the data. the research found that administrators' motives for offering online academic degree programs mainly involve in answering to the high demand of prospective students. six major themes were identified with regard to influencing factors for administrators' motives: demands for programs mission to support education readiness of infrastructure teaching staff as well as applicability of content overcoming the shortage of classroom space and teachers obtaining revenue and gaining prestige.

2018;according to researches motivation that initiates and sustains behaviour is one of the most significant components of learning in any environment. accordingly level of intrinsic motivation triggers and sustains the interest of the open and distance education students when it comes to learning on their own in e-learning environments. despite a comprehensive literature regarding the motivation of those learning in traditional learning environments the number of studies addressing the motivation of open and distance education students in e-learning environments is not sufficient. in this context this study aims at determining the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students. thus data were collected from 1639 distance education students in 22 programmes through intrinsic motivation in e-learning questionnaire developed and validated to that end. analyses carried out indicate that the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students is high in e-learning environments but there is not a statistically significant difference by gender programme structure (graduate/undergraduate) instruction type (distance-blended) and academic disciplines.
2018;with the recent advances in information technologies learning management systems have taken on a significant role in providing educational resources. the successful use of these systems in higher education is important for the implementation management and continuous improvement of e-learning services to increase the quality of learning. this study aimed to identify the factors affecting higher education students' behavioral intention towards learning management systems. a research model was proposed based on the belief factors of the technology acceptance model namely perceived usefulness perceived ease-of-use and external factors including self-efficacy enjoyment subjective norm satisfaction and interactivity and control. then a self-reported questionnaire was distributed online. a total of 470 higher education students participated in the survey. the proposed structural model was assessed and validated using structural equation modeling in particular the partial least square method. the predictors of behavioral intention were identified as perceived usefulness perceived ease of use enjoyment subjective norm satisfaction and interactivity and control with the validated structural model. the relationships between the influencing factors provided an insight about the students' behavioral intention towards the use of learning management systems. it is expected that the academicians and practitioners will benefit from the design and findings of the current study in their future research.
2018;the purpose of this study was to reveal the students' perceptions on blended learning through the q method. the originality of the research stems from determining whether the students have a general tendency towards the blended learning process and evaluating the whole process through identifying its prominent components. the research data was compiled through the q-sort and the judgemental statements created by the researchers from 31 students attending the 3rd and 4th classes of the faculty of education during the 2016-2017 academic year. the data analysis ascertained that the students were in affirmative consensus on blended learning and the prominent components of the process were listed as teaching stair face-to-face classes student roles and the features of online course materials. the findings obtained were discussed within the frame of the relevant literature and the suggestions were made on blended course design.
2018;in the relevant literature it is often debated whether learning programming requires high-level thinking skills the lack of which consequently results in the failure of students in programming. the complex nature of programming and individual differences including study approaches thinking styles and the focus of supervision all have an effect on students' achievement in programming. how students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. in this regard the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students' attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. in this study a single-factor pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. the study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in turkey. to implement problem-based learning activities a teaching environment was created with the moodle platform allowing for group work and discussions. seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. in the data collection phase the study approach scale the attitude towards programming scale and the academic achievement test were employed. t-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. according to the findings of the present study students adopting the deep study approach were more successful than the students adopting a superficial approach. moreover it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students' attitude toward programming.
2018;objectives: as the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more widespread additional risk related to the learning curve can be expected. this article reports the results of a delphi process to define procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as for example lung cancer and thymoma surgery. methods: in june 2016 a working panel was spontaneously created by members of the european society of thoracic surgeons (ests) and european association for cardio-thoracic surgery (eacts) with a specialist interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. an e-consensus-finding exercise using the delphi methodology was applied requiring 80% agreement to reach consensus on each question. repeated iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds. results: agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway the basic robotic curriculum should include a baseline evaluation an e-learning module a simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation dry lab and wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. advanced robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right upper lobe) with video demonstration access to video library of robotic procedures simulation training modular console training to index procedure transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent examiners. conclusions: agreement was reached on a large number of questions to optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in robotic activity. the production of the content of the learning material is ongoing.
2018;the purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive and descriptive review of the earlier research done on the refinement of the community of inquiry framework (garrison anderson & archer 2000 2001 2010) that has greatly influenced both research and practice in online education so far. to this end the current review included peer-reviewed journal articles only by handling them both individually and determining their common theoretical and methodological aspects. the results revealed that previous research produced very significant insights into the revision of the framework by producing four new presence types and seven presence dimensions. however there were some theoretical methodological and empirical gaps that need to be addressed in the future. specifically speaking these gaps ranged from addressing certain educational contexts to focusing on statistical significance only in some of earlier research. accordingly all the findings led to the conclusion that addressing the existing gaps in further research would enrich our understanding of the community of inquiry framework thereby adding to the contributions of previous revision studies done on it and positively impacting online learning research and practice.
2018;background: recommending effective minor ailment treatments and using non-prescription or over-the-counter (otc) medicines is a pharmacist's duty. although common in most european countries self-medication counseling practices may differ from country to country. objectives: this study explored turkish community pharmacists' attitudes concerning the present self-medication market professional responsibilities toward patients' self-care and the usefulness of e-learning for patients' counseling education. methods: the study was comprised of three phases: initially a document content analysis searched for relevant otc regulatory and/or practice frameworks secondly qualitative individual interviews on self-medication with purposively selected turkish community pharmacists were performed finally a focus group with practitioners and continuing education experts was conducted to deepen previous results. a thematic data analysis based on the attitudinal theory was conducted supported by maxqda v12 software. results: sixteen documental sources allowed the extraction of three initial main themes: self-medication classification of medicines and pharmacists' role. individual interviews outlined four themes that informed the focus group discussion which produced four new themes. themes and their codes reflected dissimilar practitioners' cognitions towards otcs otc usage and self-medication particularly if compared to other european conceptualizations. contradictory feelings towards the value of otcs for professional development e.g. patient counseling influenced by profit-based expectations were identified. conclusion: turkish community pharmacists and their minor ailments treatment competences have yet to thrive as a relevant professional intervention. there are risks of missing the best pharmacy practice standards thus losing their contribution to rational self-care. besides weakening the societal recognition of the profession to help individuals' everyday health decisions and well-being there might be a reduced active role in public health.
2018;the purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers' argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches which included concept mapping collaborative game playing and group lesson planning. the participants were ten high school science teachers from us high schools who elected to attend the workshop. to begin and end the teacher workshop teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. researchers audio-recorded individual teachers' argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers' argumentation. toulmin's argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants' argumentative statements. while the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly the quality of participants' argumentation did increase significantly. as these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers' argumentation. additionally these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants' knowledge facilitate the presentation of argumentation and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers' argumentation skills.
2018;adaptive approaches within distance learning systems enable adapting teaching process to the needs of each learner during the learning process. this paper presents an algorithm for creating an adaptive learning process that provides knowledge and skills improvement for learners in the java programming language. also it presents the application of the tool that checks the learner's knowledge through solving practical tasks from the java programming language. the adaptive learning process in this work leads the learner through teaching materials and practical tasks where the acquired knowledge is required to be applied. also the algorithm based on the measurement of knowledge and time spent on a particular part of the learning process with detailed feedback and the demonstration of observed deficiencies directs the learner to teaching materials that allow improving the demonstrated knowledge. teaching materials are conceived as learning objects and as such allow for the application of adaptive approach. an analysis of the effectiveness of the algorithm and tool for practical knowledge testing from the java programming language was done with a test group of learners who gave their opinions and grades.
2018;technology diverts engineering education into learning management system for distance education activities. learning management system facilitates the management of education and training process including instructor-student student-student and student-content communication. nevertheless distance education has some disadvantages of not being able to establish active communication with students as in traditional education. this research offers a system which merges student emotion recognition with learning management system. this study aims to investigate the effects of merging student emotion recognition with learning management systems on learners' motivation and academic achievements. in this research the quasi-experimental design adopted 103 engineering students who were divided into three groups: the control group (participates in face-to-face education) the experimental group i (uses a system that merges emotion recognition with learning management system) and the experimental group ii (uses learning management system). as a result of the research it was found that the academic achievement and motivation of the experimental group i was significantly better than performance of the experimental ii and the control group.
2018;human-robot interaction hri is one of the most important research areas in robotics. a novel approach for hri on a robotic arm is proposed by using online teaching to eliminate the effect of tool inertia. the position error is reduced in repeated motion. a multi-axis f/t sensor is attached to denso robotic arm to measure six components of force and torque. a new controller structure is introduced by modifying the virtual spring control with tool inertia effect compensation. the human hand force and torque are transformed to the desired position/orientation (p/o) through the instantaneous matching between the direct human guidance and the robot response. the motions according to the experimental results have been compared with different teaching control variables. the results are shown significant improvement in teaching performance. the repeated motion errors are obviously reduced.
2018;in this brief we investigate online training of long short term memory (lstm) architectures in a distributed network of nodes where each node employs an lstm-based structure for online regression. in particular each node sequentially receives a variable length data sequence with its label and can only exchange information with its neighbors to train the lstm architecture. we first provide a generic lstm-based regression structure for each node. in order to train this structure we put the lstm equations in a nonlinear state-space form for each node and then introduce a highly effective and efficient distributed particle filtering (dpf)-based training algorithm. we also introduce a distributed extended kalman filtering-based training algorithm for comparison. here our dpf-based training algorithm guarantees convergence to the performance of the optimal lstm coefficients in the mean square error sense under certain conditions. we achieve this performance with communication and computational complexity in the order of the first-order gradient-based methods. through both simulated and reallife examples we illustrate significant performance improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

2018;following theoretical frameworks including social-cognitive theory constructivism and creating collaborative learning community this correlational study elucidates the community of inquiry framework in regard to self-regulation metacognition and motivation in an online learning setting. data were collected from 1535 students enrolled to an online information and communication technology-i course offered by the department of informatics at a well-known public university. the data were collected online through survey monkey and then analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using multiple linear regression analysis through spss version 23 statistical software. the findings notably revealed that self-regulation metacognition and motivation significantly contributed to the prediction of community of inquiry and its three presence types. the findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation for overall community of inquiry and its three presence types due to its significantly valuable contribution. this study resulted in a new tentative model adding a new construct of regulatory presence addressing learners' self-regulation. further research could concentrate on this new tentative model in addition to the new construct.
2019;the student information system (sis) has increasingly gained popularity among universities for various reasons. however evaluating student's trust and satisfaction of the system are not fully investigated. in this research a sample of 634 students participated in the study from cyprus international university cyprus. the structural equation modelling (sem) technique was employed with amos 23 software to identify the trust and satisfaction of students' sis usage. the study model which include subjective norm image output quality result demonstrability perceived usefulness perceived ease of use trust and satisfaction was developed based on extended technology acceptance model (tam ii). results obtained from the analysis indicated that image output quality result demonstrability and perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. trust was found to be significantly correlated with satisfaction however subjective norm perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant influence on satisfaction. furthermore the finding confirmed that several constructs in the tam ii that were important in previous studies were not significant in the sis. the students' behavior aspects are essential for the effective use of the system. it provides valuable information for university management in understanding the challenges of student's trust and satisfaction about sis usage.
2019;openness in education is an evolving concept which is shaped by the changing needs of societies cultures geographies and economies thus it does not have a precise definition. by focusing on four sets of generic keywords - open education open learning open educational resources (oers) and open educational practices (oeps) - this paper examines research in openness in education through a systematic review of peer reviewed literature. in doing so the researchers sought to draw attention to existing trends and patterns and possible future trajectories of openness in education. content analysis social network analysis and text-mining are the methods used for data collection and analysis. findings show that there has been growing interest on openness in education particularly on oers across different fields. findings also point to oeps as an emerging area of study which offers a fertile ground for future research. however on closer inspection a divide can be observed between the global north and global south in terms of research output.
2019;a wide variety of demand in e-learning and web-based learning caused a new approach in e-content presentation. in order to accomplish these demands learning object repositories (lors) were developed. lors have many learning objects (los) that are used to produce different types of e-content. when there are many los in lors the evaluation and selection of them become a subjective and time-consuming process. thus selecting the most suitable and best qualified lo is considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) problem. in this study a hybrid analytic hierarchy process genetic algorithm (ahp-ga) method was developed for the evaluation of los from web-based intelligent learning object framework (zonesa) lor. this proposed hybrid system was used in a real case study and the results demonstrated that the proposed system can be used effectively by both users and machines to produce content by the help of lo metadata.
2019;background: this paper examines one ec-funded multinational project (rescap-med) with a focus on research capacity building (rcb) concerning non-communicable diseases (ncds) in the mediterranean middle east and north africa. by the project's end (2015) the entire region was engulfed in crisis. objective: designed before this crisis developed in 2011 the primary purpose of rescap-med was to foster methodological skills needed to conduct multi-disciplinary research on ncds and their social determinants. rescap-med also sought to consolidate regional networks for future collaboration and to boost existing regional policy engagement in the region on the ncd challenge. this analysis examines the scope and sustainability of rcb conducted in a context of intensifying political turmoil. methods: rescap-med linked two sets of activities. the first was a framework for training early- and mid-career researchers through discipline-based and writing workshops plus short fellowships for sustained mentoring. the second integrated public-facing activities designed to raise the profile of the ncd burden in the region and its implications for policymakers at national level. key to this were two conferences to showcase regional research on ncds and the development of an e-learning resource (netph). results: seven discipline-based workshops (with 113 participants) and 6 workshops to develop writing skills (84 participants) were held with 18 fellowship visits. the 2 symposia in istanbul and beirut attracted 280 participants. yet the developing political crisis tagged each activity with a series of logistical challenges none of which was initially envisaged. the immediacy of the crisis inevitably deflected from policy attention to the challenges of ncds. conclusions: this programme to strengthen research capacity for one priority area of global public health took place as a narrow window of political opportunity was closing. the key lessons concern issues of sustainability and the paramount importance of responsively shaping a context-driven rcb.
2019;the web content accessibility guidelines was developed by world wide web consortium with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals organizations and governments. given that there is a large percentage of very small entities that develop software who also utilize the iso/iec software process standard the purpose of this study is the development of software design patterns for users with visual disabilities. as a result four accessibility design patterns are defined: authentication adapter blindness adapter dichromatic color vision adapter and blurry vision adapter. these patterns will help to improve the design of the web applications built using them while being compliant with the iso/iec 29110 standard. the use of design patterns also enables the transfer of design experience to programming practices and improves the software documentation. to validate the set of patterns an online course for spanish speakers was developed and the evaluation was carried out using simulators automated tools experts and users. simulators and automated tools showed no accessibility errors and experts evaluated 10 heuristics principles and did not identify any severity issues. taken together our results provide positive evidence that users with visual disabilities could benefit from the proposed features.

2019;the aim of this study is to examine students' acceptance of and intention to use learning management systems (lmss) for university education in turkey using extended technology acceptance model (e-tam). tam has been widely used in various fields of technology acceptance in the last years and is found to be highly useful for the determination of the factors influencing the intention to use and adopt e-learning platforms at universities. however studies in this field have not converged around a uniform version of tam. almost all studies used different factors samples or technologies to study behavioral intention. in this study the most commonly used factors are compiled in one model. results show that intention to use a lms is affected from perceived usefulness perceived ease of use and social norm. at the same time perceived usefulness is affected from perceived ease of use social norm and user interface design and perceived ease of use is affected from user interface design and computer self-efficacy. practitioners notes what is already known about this topic e-tam is successfully applied to various e-learning platforms (such as moodle blackboard iwill web-based learning system gadgets and etc.) to examine students' acceptance and intention to use. according to the literature the external variables are various and social norm user interface design and computer self-efficacy are most commonly used or suggested factors. what this paper adds in this study most common factors which were not used altogether in one framework in other studies are used to discover the behavioral intention to use a learning management system (lms). the model is applied to two different sample groups by taking into consideration adoption issues. the proposed model of this study is analyzed by sem technique to confirm the path and to find the best model fitting values. implications for practice and/or policy using this model the learning environment will improve and it will attract students more that will increase their intention to use lms. this study would help universities to increase lms usage by considering social norms user interface design and computer self-efficacy.
2019;this descriptive study which adopts a mixed-methods approach investigates whether the language learning component of the distance education program at a vocational school of higher education contributes to the students' lifelong learning propensities 21st-century skills and sustainability of their language education. a questionnaire eliciting answers from four standpoints were administered to students receiving english language instruction in the program. as for the qualitative side of the study group interviews were held with volunteers. the quantitative data were analyzed by a statistical program while the interview data were subjected to content analysis. the findings reveal that although the students have a positive attitude toward language learning in a distance education program they frequently refer to the need for the presence of a teacher for a variety of reasons. on the other hand it appears that the requirements of the language component of the program contributed to the students' plans for sustainability of their education after graduation. the results further indicate a need for more interaction and collaboration to be incorporated in the activities and that the philosophy underpinning the program curriculum and materials need to be reconsidered to equip the students to compete with the dynamics of the educational world.
2019;open and distance learning (odl) has a long history one marked by the emergence of open universities which was a critical development in the ecology of openness. open universities have taken on significant local and global roles within the framework of meeting the needs of their respective regions of influence and as such their roles have evolved over time. against this background the purpose of this research is to explore the open university phenomenon by examining the case of anadolu university in turkey a mega university that has transformed into what is now a giga university. more specifically the research first looks at openness in education and how the concept itself has led to the emergence of open universities before turning attention to anadolu university which is a dual-mode state university with around 3 million enrolled students. other issues that are addressed as part of this research include the rise of odl and how it positioned itself within turkish higher education the historical development of anadolu university and its massiveness in terms of student numbers and services provided local and global odl practices learner profiles learning materials and spaces exams and assessment and evaluation processes learner support services and anadolu university's contribution as an open university to the field of odl. the research shows that as an open university anadolu university has narrowed the information gap and digital divide has enhanced equality of opportunity in education and has provided lifelong learning opportunities. more importantly as an institution that has gone beyond the conventional understanding of an open university anadolu university serves as a catalyst of change and innovation in its emergence as a role model for other higher education institutions. the following recommendations were able to be developed from the examinations of this study: (1) develop a definition of openness based on the changing paradigms of the 21st century and online learning (2) enter into national and international collaborations between open universities (3) adopt culturally relevant open pedagogies (4) develop and design heutagogy-based curricula and (5) unbundle odl services in mega and giga universities.
2021;this study aims to investigate learners' interaction with the learning dashboards as a predictor outcome of an online learning experience and to what extent this interaction data could be used to predict and/or provide guidance through their academic performance. for this purpose a prescriptive learning dashboard integrated into an e-learning environment was developed as a learning analytics tool. the participants consisted of 126 higher education students enrolled in the 12-week computer networks and communication course. data gathered through logs and academic performances of learners were analysed with data mining techniques. the result of cluster analysis based on interaction with the prescriptive learning dashboard showed that learners were separated into four groups according to their behavioural patterns. a similar pattern appears when the related clusters are profiled based on the academic performances. at predictive analysis the study indicates that the interaction with prescriptive learning dashboard had certain effects on academic performance of learners significantly and artificial neural networks algorithm yielded the best performance for predicting academic performance. the results support that the usage prescriptive learning dashboards can be applied in online courses as an instructional aid to improve performance of learners and learning design in e-learning environments.
2019;distance education (de) is a constantly evolving and advancing field and as such its intellectual network and dynamics need to be investigated and explored. in this regard this study reviewed a total of 1685 articles and 51940 references through social network analysis for a bibliometric examination of the de field. the findings indicate that de is an interdisciplinary field and part of mainstream education. the progressive knowledge domain analysis revealed that the intellectual roots of de stem from generic social learning theories after which de-related theories began to emerge following the foundation of open universities. the research concludes that there was a paradigm shift that resulted from developments in online networked technologies in the 2000s at which time de started to gradually evolve into sixth generation ubiquitous de.
2020;prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. in the studies carried out with artificial neural networks performance predictions based on student scores are generally made but students' use of learning management system is not focused. in this study performances of 3518 university students who studying and actively participating in a learning management system were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender content score time spent on the content number of entries to content homework score number of attendance to live sessions total time spent in live sessions number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables these networks are called black boxes. also in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. the artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47%. finally it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.
2019;the purpose of the study is to investigate the concern developments of first-time distance education instructors using the concerns-based adoption model (cbam). this study used stages of concern (soc) a component of cbam as its theoretical framework. a descriptive case study was implemented which focused on the adaptation processes of nine instructors lecturing for the first time via distance education. the instructors attended a two-day training which was designed based on their initial concerns. then instructors implemented their courses for four weeks via distance education. while the informational and personal stages (self-concerns) decreased compared to the initial findings the consequence stage increased in intensity. however self-concerns remained predominant in the process despite the reduction in self-concerns and increase in the consequence stage. based on the findings the implications for distance education and recommendations for addressing the instructors' concerns are discussed. recommendations for alleviating the concerns of first-time distance education instructors include: the provision of ongoing concern-based interventions that incorporate technological pedagogical and content knowledge providing working examples related to distance education from which instructors can learn vicariously and encouraging collaboration among instructors.
2019;the aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of articles related to the use of augmented reality (ar) in science education. for bibliometric mapping analysis a total of 147 articles were accessed and for content analysis a total of 79 articles published between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the web of science. from this a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. our results revealed that mobile learning science education science learning and e-learning were the most used keywords in articles while the focus of more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. the results showed that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and e-learning environments. the most-used words in the abstracts were education knowledge science education experiment and effectiveness. it is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students' knowledge and achievement. azuma dunleavy and klopfer are the most cited authors in this field. this is not surprising as they are probably the leading authors on ar in the literature. the most cited journals are computers & education journal of science education & technology educational technology and society computers in human behavior and british journal of educational technology. these are the most prominent journals on the use of technology in education. content analysis results showed that learning/academic achievement motivation and attitude have been the most examined variables in the articles. since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and attitude it is understandable that these variables are considered together in reviewed studies. it was found that mobile applications and marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of materials for ar because these types of materials are easy to use and they can be developed easily and practically. quantitative studies were the most used research design type but there have been only a limited number of qualitative studies in the last six years. this may be due to the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent years.
2020;the current study was based on weidlich and bastiaens's sips model. the variables included in the study were modeled to reveal their roles in online learning environments. the data collected from 396 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in one or more distance learning courses on and before the 2017-2018 academic year spring semester in a public turkish university and participated in the study. a combined data collection instrument that included 61 items and a demographic information form and five scales was utilized. it was observed that the sips model tested with structural equation model in the present study was confirmed for the turkish sample. one predicted variable was determined (predictive learning) by regression analysis and in this analysis it was determined that sociability and social interaction were not significant predictors. only sociability was not a significant classificatory variable in chaid.

2020;in this paper we study anomaly detection in a distributed network of nodes and introduce a novel algorithm based on support vector machines (svms). we first reformulate the conventional svm optimization problem for a distributed network of nodes. we then directly train the parameters of this svm architecture in its primal form using a gradient based algorithm in a fully distributed manner i.e. each node in our network is allowed to communicate only with its neighboring nodes in order to train the parameters. therefore we not only obtain a high performing anomaly detection algorithm thanks to strong modeling capabilities of svms but also achieve significantly reduced communication load and computational complexity due to our fully distributed and efficient gradient based training. here we provide a training algorithm in a supervised framework however we also provide the extensions of our implementation to an unsupervised framework. we illustrate the performance gains achieved by our algorithm via several benchmark real life and synthetic experiments.

2020;with the integration of popular technologies such as social media smartphones and tablets in the education system new online course delivery methods such as flipped classrooms have emerged to enhance teaching and learning. to understand implications of the integration of such technologies in education the study examined the responses of 550 preservice teachers. participants took their regular classes on a flipped classroom during a semester. after this experience the participants completed a survey instrument adapted for this study to measure their continuous intention to use flipped classroom. the research model which is based on technology acceptance model and social cognitive theory was tested by employing a structural equation modelling approach. results indicated that self-regulation and self-efficacy have a positive impact on perceived ease of use (peou). whereas perceived anxiety has a negative impact on the peou and self-efficacy. self-efficacy mediates the relationship between perceived anxiety and peou. further the results indicated that peou has a positive impact on perceived usefulness (pu). both pu and peou have a positive impact on the continuous intention to use flipped classroom for teaching and learning. the findings suggested significant relationships between cognitive and technological factors and continuous intention to use flipped classroom.
2020;objectives there is no standardised and up-to-date education model for urology residents in our country. we aimed to describe our national e-learning education model for urology residents. methodology the ertp working group consisting of urologists was established by the society of urological surgery to create e-learning model and curriculum in april 2018. learning objectives were set up in order to determine and standardise the contents of the presentations. in accordance with the bloom taxonomy 834 learning objectives were created for a total of 90 lectures (18 lectures for each pgy year). totally 90 videos were shot by specialised instructors and webcasts were prepared. webcasts were posted at uropedia.com.tr which is the web library of the society of urological surgery. the satisfaction of residents and instructors was evaluated with feedbacks. an assessment of knowledge was measured with the multiple-choice exam. results a total of 43 centres and 250 urology residents were included in ertp during the academic year 2018/2019. there were 93/55/43/34/25 urology residents at 1st/2nd/3rd/4th and 5th year of residency respectively. majority of the residents (99.1%) completed the ertp. the overall satisfaction rate of residents and instructors were 4.29 and 4.67 (min: 1 so bad max: 5 so good). an assessment exam was performed to urology residents at the end of the ertp and the mean score was calculated as 57.99 points (min: 20 max: 82). conclusion as a result of the covid-19 pandemic most of the educational programmes had to move online platforms. we used this reliable and easily accessible e-learning platform for the standardisation of training in urology on national basis. we aim to share this model with international residency training programmes.
2020;today's dynamic distance learning environments offer a flexible comfortable and lifelong learning experience independent of space and time. in this way it also supports and develops existing traditional training programs. the increasing importance of knowledge skills and learning in today's technological life cycle has led to an increase and diversification of research and applications in distance learning. accordingly distance learning literature has a rich content supported by a multidisciplinary background. from this point of view it is crucial to perceive the research landscape reflecting the general themes and trends studied in the field of distance learning. this study aims at revealing the distance learning research themes and trends by analyzing the 27735 articles of journal conducted in the last decade. the methodology of the study is based on semantic content analysis implemented by n-gram-based text categorization technique. as a result 10 main themes are discovered namely system establishment media assessment method content education levels learner research methods interaction-communication and resource-material-tool. in this context the findings of the study are expected to provide significant insights to guide prospective research and practice in the field and to develop continuous improvements and standards for distance education communities.
2020;this study defines and analyses adaptive gamification design principles for online courses. it was conducted as a holistic single case study framed by two theoretical approaches namely gamification and adaptive learning. the first part of the study establishes a theoretical matrix with its contents converted into a questionnaire which includes nine semi-structured questions. following this a four-round delphi panel with 12 field experts was performed. in the second part the design principle proposition checklist was presented to a focus group of six formed by experts in the field of open and distance education to obtain their feedback on its usability applicability and significance. the qualitative data obtained in the first phase was analysed by using content analysis while the quantitative data obtained in the other phases were analysed by calculating the distribution of frequencies and measures of central tendency. results of the delphi rounds and the focus group interview yielded a checklist of adaptive gamification design principles for online courses comprising 102 design principles under 11 themes.
2020;video lectures are one of the primary learning resources embedded in e-learning environments. many universities prepare video lectures and share them as open course materials with students. in order to make the learning process more efficient and effective it is very important to design and personalize those learning resources for learners taking into their needs and cognitive differences. the literature regarding how cognitively diverse users benefit from which media design is scarce. therefore the purpose of this research is to explore the effect of video lectures types (voice over type picture-in-picture type and screencast type) and learners' sustained attention levels (low and high) on their learning performance in an e-learning environment. the research was designed as a 2 x 3 factorial design. in addition learners' eye movements have been recorded during study sessions. results indicate that main effect of learners' sustained attention levels and video lecture types on learning performance were significant. furthermore it was observed that both for the students with high level of sustained attention and for the students with low level of sustained attention the use of picture-in-picture types of video lectures led higher learning performance scores. similarly the eye tracking analyses also supported this finding.
2020;the covid-19 pandemic has caused teachers and students to abandon their physical classrooms and move into emergency distance education (ede) settings. thus sustaining the quality in education has become a challenge during this transitional period. within this context the aim of this study was to explore the impact of ede on language skills development (reading writing listening and speaking) of turkish pre-service teachers of english as a foreign language (efl). in this qualitative study data were gathered from 118 pre-service efl teachers about the advantages and disadvantages of ede for their language skills development. thematic analysis was used as a research design and nine themes emerged for both advantages and disadvantages. the most important theme for both categories is content and implementation of online courses. this study pinpointed the eminence of this theme for if it is emphasized enough and handled efficiently it plays a huge role in developing language skills. the themes and sub-themes generated through thematic analysis showed the advantages and disadvantages of ede for each skill in detail and also proved that ede was most advantageous for writing skill and least advantageous for speaking skill. the participants stated that since writing skill was constantly used for almost all homework assignments and projects that skill was nurtured the most. nevertheless speaking skill was ignored during online courses and writing became the new mode of communication by replacing speaking. the outcome of the present study encourages preparedness for ede against a possible second wave. thus the study is hoped to pave the way for anticipating issues and developing solutions for ede contexts to preserve sustainability in higher education.
2020;in this experimental study an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy bayesian intelligent tutoring system (fb-its) is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. the effectiveness of the fb-its was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an intelligent tutoring system (its) fuzzy its and bayesian its separately. moreover it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. in order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not analysis of covariance (ancova) was used based on the students' pre-test and post-test scores. the study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. results showed that students who studied using fb-its had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. regarding the time taken to perform the post-test the results indicated that students who used the fb-its needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. from the results it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success.
2020;this study aims to develop an attitude scale towards distance learning and conduct a validity and reliability study for it. the study uses two study groups. the first group comprises 384 university students conducting exploratory factor analysis and the second comprises 305 students conducting confirmatory factor analysis. the analysis resulted in a 16 item four-factor structure with factor loading values all between 0.45 and 0.94. this structure makes up for 54.4% of the total variance. the factors were named usefulness communication preference for distance learning and preference for face to face learning. the confirmatory factor analysis results show that this model displays decent coherence. the reliability studies show that internal consistency coefficients are values all between 0.67 and 0.84. it was also discovered that the scale dimensions display no difference with regard to gender. these results show that this scale is a valid and reliable tool.
2021;e-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content assessment and discussion. yet after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. it is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. on the other hand multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. this study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. in this context the research has two main objectives. firstly it aims to utilize the electre tri method which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. secondly it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the electre tri method and the classification in the real life. to that end two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. the first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. three different categories are identified in the first data set by the electre tri method. based on this finding the classification in the electre tri method is compared to the real-life classification which shows a medium-level correlation. two different categories are identified in the second data set. there is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. in conclusion this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments.
2020;the present study which is conducted based on interactive application of the role play method which is one of the game-based learning techniques to distance education undergraduate students aims to the tourism students to simulate a learning situation with the role play method. the case study is selected as the methodology in the study and the role-play application is conducted in three stages as a design-based research approach: preparation implementation evaluation and reflection. the study findings provide a framework for assessing how learning technologies can support role-based learning activities in distance education based on the needs of both the students and educators. furthermore the study findings indicate that both simultaneous and asynchronous online platforms are effective tools that improved communications skills of the students as well as their collaboration and interaction levels.
2021;student modeling is one of the most important processes in adaptive systems. although learning is individual a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. since a student model can be created for more than one student the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. artificial neural networks (anns) which form one group of machine learning techniques are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. convolutional neural networks (cnns) which are specific types of these networks are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing computer vision and speech recognition. in this study a student model was created using a cnn due to the complexity of the learning process and the performance of the model was examined. the student modeling technique used was named learnerprints. the navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. the classification results showed that cnns can be used effectively for student modeling. the modeling was based on the students' achievement and used the students' data from the learning management system. the study found that the learnerprints technique classified students with an accuracy of over 80%.
2021;electrical circuits constitute the core of many courses at the undergraduate level in electrical and electronics engineering. for most undergraduate students learning and analyzing such circuits are a difficult process. a significant drawback of simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (spice)-based simulation tools in terms of e-learning is that they only generate circuit simulation outputs such as the current and voltage of electrical elements contained in a particular circuit. the users are not provided with the detailed information about the steps that are followed to obtain the related outputs. this study describes the development of a new software tool called ecdat (a shorthand for the electrical circuit description and analysis tool) which can serve as a practical component of electrical circuits courses. the developed tool currently analyzes simple direct electric circuits in a similar way as the existing circuit analysis and simulation ones and it produces an output document that includes the certain equations and intermediate calculations using the well-known circuit laws differently from the previous works. another contribution of the study is that unlike the modified nodal analysis method used in spice-based circuit analysis programs it employs a graph analysis method for circuit analysis.
2021;the aim of the article is to highlight the key elements related to the implementation of new technologies in education from the perspective of the opinions and experiences of educators in the field in bolivia brazil the dominican republic ecuador finland poland turkey and uruguay. the text compares issues related to attitudes towards the use of new media in education experiences with different forms of e-learning and the level of restrictions on the use of smartphones in school. these variables are juxtaposed with the self-assessment of digital competence and how cyberspace is used. the survey was conducted using a standardised survey questionnaire translated into the relevant national languages in the first half of 2019 and involved a sample of 873 teachers representing eight countries. on the basis of the pilot studies it was noted that: 1) teachers from lac and eu like to use digital media - this is a constant trend independent of geographical location 2) teachers note that new technologies are not always better than analogue didactic aids 3) teachers from selected countries (the dominican republic brazil turkey and uruguay) have much greater techno-optimism in themselves than teachers from bolivia poland finland and turkey in terms of the impact of ict on student motivation and engagement 4) in all countries teachers prefer free online courses (the different forms of e-learning are used most often by those in the dominican republic and the least often in bolivia and poland) 5) in each country teachers who highly value their own digital competences and have a positive attitude towards new media use ict much more actively 6) there is also a global trend in that the extensive use of cyberspace (typical e-services) appears in combination with the extensive use of various forms of e-learning 7) teachers from ecuador are most likely to want to ban the use of smartphones in schools. the most liberal approach in this respect is taken by the uruguayans 8) the knowledge of the conditions related to restricting the use of smartphones goes beyond the analyses related to the style of use and attitude towards new media. this article is the result of pilot studies conducted within the framework of the smart ecosystem for learning and inclusion project carried out in selected latin american caribbean (lac) and european (eu) countries.
2021;depending on the global world conditions and technological developments the education and job status of people are constantly changing. in the competitive environment of today as in many other sectors it has become necessary to compete with the competitors in the education sector and to open up to new markets. universities are the most important education centers where qualified human resources are trained. universities offer different types of education along with people's lifestyles and technology. distance education has become increasingly widespread in recent years as it can meet human needs. it has become necessary for universities to evaluate their performance to compete with their competitors in distance education. in recent years data envelopment analysis (dea) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (topsis) are widely used in performance evaluation. in this study it has been aimed at performance evaluation of distance education departments of public universities in turkey for the 2018-2019 academic year by using the dea method and the topsis method. in the study it has been also aimed to compare and rank the efficient decision-making units as a result of efficiency measurement among themselves. the study has been carried out using 6 input and 4 output variables. as a result of the efficiency analysis using the ccr-dea model 7 universities were efficient and 49 universities not. later the efficient universities have been ranked using the super efficiency ccr-dea model and topsis method.
2021;in this current era of the fourth industrial revolution the fifth generation of distance education has held out hopes of unique opportunities for engineering. with the aim of investigating the field of engineering through distance education this study conducted a systematic review involving text-mining and social network analysis to examine 120 publications on this topic. the time trend analysis found that there has been a steadily increasing interest in engineering through distance education. analysis of subject areas revealed that a considerable amount of the publications on engineering through distance education falls under the social sciences subject area suggesting that there is a need for more interdisciplinary studies. in examining the geographical distribution of the publications it was observed that most contributions come from the united states a developed country that has invested heavily in educating students through distance education. the research patterns identified through text-mining and social network analysis revealed three major themes: (i) technology-enhanced distance engineering education (ii) e-learning and m-learning and (iii) virtual and remote labs.
2021;massive open online courses (moocs) provide a valuable learning platform for global learners. they are extensively utilized by an increasing number of people from all over the world due to their remarkable features including unlimited enrollment the lack of location requirements free access to a high number of courses and structural similarity to traditional lectures. however high dropout rates negatively affect their educational effectiveness. in this regard as a trending research topic in recent years the prediction of dropout rates in moocs has become a critical issue in terms of planning for the future and taking precautions. this study proposes a practical prediction approach for the student dropout problem of moocs. in this regard an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (anfis) is utilized for the prediction of dropout rates in moocs for the first time in this study. the proposed approach uses the capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy inference systems thus it provides highly accurate predictions. the performance of the proposed anfis approach is benchmarked against various models developed based on several machine learning methods including the decision tree logistic regression support vector machine ensemble learning and k-nearest neighbor methods. the results reveal that the proposed approach provides higher statistical accuracy than its benchmarks meaning that the proposed approach can be used effectively for moocs.
2021;along with the covid-19 outbreak which has been a global threat for public health the unconfirmed information about the pandemic in circulation has become another threat. hence it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. the goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers' analysis of claims related to the covid-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers' analysis task focus group interviews and instructor's feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. in order to achieve this purpose the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies conspiracy theories and scientific arguments related to the covid-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. the researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high moderate and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments and judgment of the credibility of sources. the findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. however after the focus group interviews almost every participant's analysis scores of evaluation demarcation and judgment increased. the results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims. concluding remarks are made for the further implications of teaching critical evaluation of claims based on evidence.
2020;the covid-19 pandemic has drastically reduced physical activity (pa) behaviors of many people. physical education (pe) is considered one of the privileged instruments to promote youths' pa. we aimed to investigate the effects of lockdown on pe teachers' behaviors promoting their students' out-of-school pa and differences between three european countries. a sample of 1146 pe teachers (59.5% females) from france italy and turkey answered an online questionnaire about guiding students to engage in out-of-school pa helping them to set pa goals encouraging in self-monitoring pa the pedagogical formats of these behaviors and feedback asked to students. rm-mancovas were performed with a two-time (before and during the lockdown) three country (france italy turkey) two gender factorial design using teaching years and perceived health as covariates. a significant multivariate main effect time x country x gender (p < 0.001) was reported for the behaviors promoting students' pa with french and italian teachers increasing some behaviors while turkish teachers showing opposite trends. significant multivariate main effects time x country were found for formats supporting the behaviors (p < 0.001) and for asked feedback formats (p < 0.001). the massive contextual change imposed by lockdown caused different reactions in teachers from the three countries. findings are informative for pa promotion and pe teachers' education.
2021;estimating the flow state of students in a course allows evaluating their sentimental state and the challenges they are facing. in e-learning platforms the evaluation of flow state is a complex task because it depends on the ability to extract the parameters that better reflect the activity and effort of students. in this scope the current study proposes a method based on flow theory aiming to provide information about the students' flow state in a course that is taught in an e-learning environment. first the interaction of students with an e-learning platform that comprises classical e-learning pages and a timeline tool is analyzed using activity heatmaps and deep neural networks. then by taking also in account their grades the flow state of students is calculated. the resulted data are validated with a statistical analysis that also utilizes student surveys. in order to guarantee that this method is applicable to various profiles students from different faculties participated in this study. in a period where education is rapidly adapting to online lectures and e-learning platforms the estimation of student's flow state in e-learning environments can provide useful feedback and data to students and educators.
2021;purpose this study aimed to determine the relationship between nursing students' levels of technology addiction and their attitudes toward e-learning during the covid-19 pandemic. design and methods the study had a cross-sectional design and was conducted at a department of nursing in a faculty of health sciences in turkey. the study sample consisted of 434 nurses chosen by stratified sampling method. findings the nursing students had a low level of technology addiction and mildly positive attitudes toward e-learning. a statistically positive correlation was found between students' technology addiction and their attitudes toward e-learning (p < 0.01). practice implications determining the levels of technology addiction and attitudes toward e-learning in nursing students will help nurse educators in designing curricula and developing e-learning in this area.

2021;distance education (de) which has evolved under the wings of information technologies in the last decade has become a fundamental part of our modern education system. de has not only replaced the traditional education method as in social sciences and lifelong learning opportunities but also has significantly strengthened traditional education in mathematics science and engineering fields that require practical and intensive study. however it is deprived of supporting some key elements found in traditional educational approaches such as (i) modern computer laboratories with installed special software suitable for the student's field of interest (ii) adequate staff for maintenance and proper functioning of laboratories (iii) face-to-face technical support (iv) license fees. for students to overcome these shortcomings a virtual application pool is needed where they can easily access all the necessary applications via remote access. this research aims to develop a platform-independent virtual laboratory environment for de students. this article has been developed specifically to guide de institutions and to make a positive contribution to the literature. technology acceptance model (tam) has been used to explain student behaviors. it was concluded that students using the platform performed more successful grades (12.89%) on laboratory assessments and that the students using the developed platform were found to be more satisfied with the education process.
2021;the covid-19 pandemic which was reported in early january 2020 in china and spread rapidly around the globe will certainly remain as one of the most impactful disruptive events of the 21st century. to contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. this paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in istanbul turkey through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. the paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents' selfregulation and governmental measures distinguishing travel for commute social/recreational/leisure (srl) and shopping activities as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5 m closure of numerous non-essential venues encouraging teleworking and distance education job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme particularly for commuting and srl trips.
2021;this study aims to investigate the influence of learners' characteristics on their engagement during online education due to the covid-19 pandemic. the investigated learner characteristics included digital literacy self-directed learning motivation for learning and perceived stress. the data were collected from the undergraduate learners and the proposed moderated mediation model was tested. the findings showed that all learner characteristics are significant predictors of online learner engagement. besides self-directed learning and motivation significantly mediate the relationship between digital literacy and engagement while perceived stress significantly moderates the relationship of digital literacy with self-directed learning but not with motivation for learning.
2021;purpose to identify the factors affecting nursing students' attitudes towards distance education. design and methods this research was conducted as a cross-sectional descriptive and correlational study with a total of 318 nursing students (n = 380) a university in the west of turkey. findings the total average scores of the students from the attitude towards distance education scale was 101.62 +/- 24.83 (min = 43 max = 175). practice implications nursing which is an applied discipline can be difficult to maintain entirely in the formof distance learning. therefore different teaching methods can be used to develop a positive attitude towards distance education in nursing students.
2021;the main objective of this study is to determine the effects of covid-19 measures on air quality in turkey. for this investigation a daily mean of pm10 pm2.5 no2 co o-3o- and so2 air pollutant data provided from the measurement stations run by the ministry of environment and urbanisation and the istanbul and izmir metropolitan municipalities were used. the r program an open-code statistics program was used to generate associated distribution maps using the data obtained. data for 29 metropolitan cities and the province of zonguldak where the pandemic measures were first implemented were examined for air quality changes. in evaluating whether the covid-19 measures have had an impact on the air quality of the 30 given cities two time periods were selected: a period before the covid-19 measures were implemented (between january 1 and march 15) and the period in which the measures were in force (between march 16 and april 15). in order to take the effects of seasonal conditions on air quality based on the 2020 post-epidemic data into account the average data from 2018 and 2019 were also compared. this study finds that the restrictions imposed during the covid-19 pandemic period in the 30 major cities in which most of the turkish population lives significantly improved the air quality. assuming that some of the measures taken during the pandemic period will become permanent over time (such as the increase in home working the decrease in air travel thanks to online meetings the widespread use of distance education the change in consumption habits and a reduction of waste) the epidemic period is thought to represent a turning point in increasing global air quality.
2021;as covid-19 reached turkey in march 2020 all universities switched to e-learning in a very short period. computer and software engineering (ce/se) undergraduate students studying at university campuses have switched to e-learning. this paper seeks to understand the e-learning experience of ce/se undergraduate students. a questionnaire was created and applied to ce/se undergraduate students in turkish universities. the data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. the questionnaire received 290 usable responses. the highlights from the findings include: the participants (1) used video recordings intensively for e-learning and found them useful (2) found face-to-face lectures more beneficial compared to digital live lectures (3) used external online resources to improve their learning performance in courses (4) thought that the materials and methods utilized for assessment should be adapted to e-learning for a better and fair evaluation (5) perceived significantly less instructor support and classmate interaction and collaboration in e-learning compared to on-campus education settings (6) rated their perceived satisfaction from e-learning as 2.85 slightly under the mid-level of the 5-point likert scale (7) perceived instructor support student interaction and collaboration and student autonomy as noteworthy factors in high-quality e-learning.
2021;the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic caused an emergency transform from traditional to distance learning at all levels of education which is called emergency remote teaching. to explore parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the covid-19 pandemic and their experience and perspectives toward remote teaching during the lockdown of the covid-19 pandemic a questionnaire was developed and distributed to parents who have at least one child who had attended a face-to-face learning environment prior to school closures and started remote teaching during the pandemic. 983 parents participated in the study. the parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the covid-19 pandemic their experiences and perspectives toward remote teaching were discussed. the results suggested that the remote teaching process has been challenging for both students and parents. it is found that the remote teaching practices were mainly covered in core courses remote teaching is considered as unsuitable for young children and students with special needs the parents complain about social isolation lack of interactivity and increased screen time and remote teaching has placed a heavy burden on parents. lastly the parents stated that their children acquired self-regulated learning skills and digital socialization during emergency remote teaching.
2021;objectives in 2018 harvard university provided a 10-week online course titled improving global health: focusing on quality and safety as using massive online open courses (moocs) web-based platform. the course was designed for those who care about health and healthcare and wish to learn more about how to measure and improve that care - for themselves for their institutions or for their countries. the goal of this course was to provide visual and written education tools for different countries and different age groups. in respect to the aim of this study is to evaluate the impressions and benefits of group learning activity and educational needs after this improving global health courses experience with an online survey among the participants. methods sixty-six family medicine practitioners and trainees who were among the participants of the course were the universe of the study. these young general practitioners/family physicians (gps/fps) from different countries were organized among themselves to follow the course as a group activity. two weeks after the course an online survey was sent to all the participants of this group activity. results twenty-eight out of 66 participants (42.4%) completed the survey and provided feedback on their perspectives and experience. most of them were female (70.4%) and have not attended any mooc course before (63%). this international group achieved a completion rate of approximately 65% by the deadline and nearly 90% including those finishing afterward. the majority felt that the group activity proved beneficial and supportive in nature. conclusions well-structured sustainable e-learning platforms will be the near futures' medical learning devices in a world without borders. future studies should further explore facilitators and barriers among fps for enrolling and completing moocs. furthermore there is a need to evaluate how these group-learning initiatives may help participants incorporate lessons learned from the course into their daily practice.
2021;this study aims to identify the needs of early childhood educators regarding distance education during the covid-19 pandemic. this basic qualitative research was carried out with a study group of 24 early childhood educators all of whom were determined via a maximum variation sampling method. the study data were gathered via interviews conducted with the participants and analyzed through an inductive approach. the study findings showed that early childhood educators need to improve their technological competencies have more interactive resources at their disposal be able to take advantage of a user-friendly educational platform specifically designed for the early childhood period be provided with the resources to serve families and have support for their psychological well-being. considering the essential role of teachers which the covid-19 pandemic has called to mind it is of vital importance to meet the abovementioned needs so as to improve the quality of distance education in early childhood.
2021;covid-19 has caused profound changes in various dimensions of people's lives. education system is one of the areas affected most and there have been profound changes mainly with regard to teachers students and parents. the main purpose of this research is to analyse the effects of covid-19 pandemic on ict competences and experiences of classroom teachers and parents in various dimensions. scales were developed to collect data for the research. the reliability of the scale was examined by calculating cronbach alpha coefficients which were .690 and .793 for the distance education and pandemic scale respectively. in the second study a total of 1345 people participated in the study including 841 classroom teachers and 504 parents whose children attending primary schools. the findings of the second study revealed significant differences between teachers and parents. based on the findings of the current study following suggestions could be given both parents and teachers should be informed and educated about ict usage. teachers should use digital applications like web 2.0 tools which will direct them through interactive way of teaching.
2021;the aim of the study was to investigate secondary school students' and teachers' access to information technologies in turkey by making interregional comparisons. document analysis of the qualitative research methods was employed to analyze the reports issued by the turkish ministry of national education the turkish statistical institute (tuik) and the programme for international student assessment (pisa). the results of the research revealed the importance of access to information and communication technologies for both students and teachers: 67.9% of the participating students were found to have internet connection and 69.1% a computer in their homes while 80.3% of the students were observed to use a computer outside the school but 19.7% were not. the results also showed that 64.6% of the students have internet connection in their classrooms but 29.2% of these students do not use the internet in the classroom whereas 8.9% use it in the classroom all the time. the rate of students using a digital device for reading is 38.1% while that of those not using one is 61.9%. some 32.1% of secondary school students were revealed not to have internet connection at home. additionally 77% of teachers were not trained in online teaching prior to the covid-19 pandemic. based on the findings teachers can be suggested to develop projects - i.e. of tubitak e-twinning and erasmus - which potentially encourage students to use information and communication technologies so that both teachers and students can benefit from them. it is also suggested that the ministry of national education should work on improving the information communication technology competencies of teachers and students. besides policies should be developed to eliminate regional differences in terms of access to digital resources and technology in terms of equal opportunities and opportunities.
2021;while we have been looking for alternative educational materials for our undergraduate students we found ourself in covid-19 pandemic and had to think postgraduate education. on the first day of restrictions our major problem was to learn and find the best communication tool. the first experiences for online meetings were boring we were not feeling our emotions but as days past we got used to it. we all understand the importance of having alternatives and have to be ready for second choices. during those challenging days all had more time to work on our completed data time to write complete the proofreading of written materials. other vital scientific activities for career development and profile building such as reading (every meeting with new articles/reviews) publishing and preparing oral presentation were fully completed during the online meetings as a part of lab meeting activities. they learned to improve communication skills be active participants and fight.
2021;the covid-19 pandemic has led to a rapid transition from face-to-face to distance learning. the problems caused by this rapid transition are combined with the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic leading to numerous problems and difficulties in the teaching and learning processes. the recentness of these issues and developments requires detailed investigation as to how they affect distance learning. this study aims to investigate the role of psycho-demographic variables in the motivation and attendance of higher education students in distance education within the context of the covid-19 pandemic. in this descriptive study we collected data from 1494 turkish university students via an online survey. quantitative data were analysed using correlation analysis t test one-way anova multiple linear regression analysis and structural equation modelling. stress anxiety depression and intolerance of uncertainty were correlated negatively with distance learning motivation and frequency of distance learning attendance. while students who attended distance learning only synchronously joined the courses more frequently the motivation of those who joined the courses sometimes synchronously and sometimes asynchronously was higher. the strength of the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and distance learning motivation was significantly increased via anxiety and depression. findings highlight the need for analysis of psycho-demographic variables while designing and implementing distance education programmes. psychological variables including stress anxiety and depression are related to motivation and attendance during distance education. while using both synchronous and asynchronous distance learning enhances motivation synchronous learning increases attendance.
2021;e-learning studies are becoming very important today as they provide alternatives and support to all types of teaching and learning programs. the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. accordingly gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. there are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. this study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent dirichlet allocation (lda) on 41925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. the analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. among these the topics mooc learning assessment and elearning systems were found to be key topics in the field with a consistently high volume. in addition the topics of learning algorithms learning factors and adaptive learning were observed to have the highest overall acceleration with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. going by these results it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. in other words after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. these insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly.
2021;the field of distance education (de) is dynamic and constantly evolving it reflects and adapts according to changes in socio-cultural demographic political and technological domains. thus there is a need to understand past and present activities in the field in order to better inform future research. the main purpose of this study was to examine de research through data mining and analytics approaches using social network analysis (sna) and text mining to conduct a bibliographic analysis. the findings highlighted three main strands of de research: (a) issues related to open education (b) the design support and quality assurance of online de and (c) the implementation and use of educational technology media and digital tools. sna of the bibliometric data identified pivotal theoretical contributions including that the fields of distance education and educational technology converge. the article concludes with recommendations for future research directions.
2021;laboratories which are an integral part of education in disciplines that require hands-on training and application can now be presented using new technologies and application activities can be realized at a distance. in this study virtual laboratories (vls) are discussed and factors affecting the students' intention to use vls are investigated. the study was conducted within laboratory applications of circuit analysis within an associate degree program of a distance teaching university in turkey. in this study which used exploratory sequential design approach the learners' intentions to use a vl were examined within the framework of the technology acceptance model (tam). content analysis was used for the analysis of qualitative data and the partial least squares structural equation model was used for the analysis of quantitative data. as a result of the study the developed tam-based research model is a useful conceptual framework towards understanding and explaining the intentions of learners' virtual laboratory usage. the results of this study will guide institutions to integrate vls effectively into the education process and to increase and disseminate the use of vls by learners.
2021;this paper reports the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the practice and delivery of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering (gge) education modules including lectures lab sessions student assessments and research activities based on the feedback from faculty members in 14 countries/regions around the world. faculty members have since adopted a series of contingent measures to enhance teaching and learning experience during the pandemic which includes facilitating active learning exploring new teaching content related to public health expanding e-learning resources implementing more engaged and student-centred assessment and delivering high-impact integrated education and research. the key challenges that faculty members are facing appear to be how to maximise the flexibility of learning and meet physical distancing requirements without compromising learning outcomes education equity and interpersonal interactions in the traditional face-to-face teaching. despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic this could also be a good opportunity for faculty members obliged to lecture to rethink and revise the existing contents and approaches of professing gge education. three future opportunities namely smart learning flipped learning and interdisciplinary education are identified. the changes could potentially provide students with a more resilient engaged interactive and technology-based learning environment.
2021;many governments decided to cancel face-to-face teaching and learning activities in schools and universities. they replaced them with online teaching and distance learning activities to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). due to this sudden change students experienced some anthropometric environmental and psychosocial difficulties at home during the distance learning process. this study focuses on determining the importance of anthropometric environmental and psychosocial factors in the distance learning process during the covid-19 pandemic. this study presents main factors and their subfactors affecting ergonomic conditions of university students during distance learning. a novel distance learning ergonomics checklist is proposed based on the occupational safety and health administration checklists. the data are collected via a questionnaire filled by 100 university students who attend the ergonomics course online. then the integrated methodology includes voting analytic hierarchy process integrated pythagorean fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is adopted to prioritize the factors determined. thirty-nine different subfactors are evaluated under five titles and the most important factors are determined using the proposed methodology. with the results achieved it is seen that the suggested checklist and proposed methodology can be used by public and private education organizations as a guide for improving their distance learning strategies.
2021;purpose traditional anatomy education (tae) is based on teaching by seeing and touching cadavers/plastic materials that enable three-dimensional thinking but there was no opportunity like this in distance anatomy education (dae). due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. in this study our aim is to evaluate students' views on the efficiency of dae and to increase the efficiency of dae in the future. methods the questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the faculty of medicine at the eskisehir osmangazi university in 2019-2020. 239 students completed the survey. the questionnaire consisted of the demographic information that was obtained with voluntary consent and sections containing suggestions on dae and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. the survey was prepared as a likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree) on google forms and sent to the students online. results 82.4% of the students marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of dae is more efficient than tae. the total percentage of students who marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of i was satisfied with the theoretical education in dae was 58.6% but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%. conclusions according to the results the efficiency of dae especially in terms of practice lessons was found to be lower than tae. to make dae a powerful alternative to tae future studies should aim to develop a new syllabus for dae.
2021;background clinical training during the covid-19 pandemic is high risk for medical students. medical schools in low- and middle-income countries (lmic) have limited capacity to develop resources in the face of rapidly developing health emergencies. here a free massive open online course (mooc) was developed as a covid-19 resource for medical students working in these settings and its effectiveness was evaluated. methods the re-aim (reach effectiveness adoption implementation and maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of mooc in teaching medical students about covid-19. the data sources included the student registration forms metrics quantifying their interactions within the modules students' course feedback and free-text responses. the data were collected from the moodle learning management system and google analytics from may 9 to september 15 2020. the research team analyzed the quantitative data descriptively and the qualitative data thematically. results among the 16237 unique visitors who accessed the course only 6031 medical students from 71 medical schools registered and about 4993 (83% of registrants) completed the course indicating high levels of satisfaction (m = 8.17 sd = 1.49) on a 10-point scale. the mean scores of each assessment modules were > 90%. the free-text responses from 987 unique students revealed a total of 17 themes (e.g. knowing the general information on covid-19 process management of the pandemic in public health online platform use and instructional design) across the elements of the re-aim framework. mainly the students characterized the mooc as well-organized and effective. conclusions medical students learned about covid-19 using a self-paced and unmonitored mooc. moocs could play a vital role in the dissemination of accurate information to medical students in lmic in future public health emergencies. the students were interested in using similar moocs in the future.
2021;this qualitative study aims to examine teachers' opinions concerning the middle school curricula that have been in use for years in order to determine its suitability for distance education during the covid-19 pandemic. the participants consisted of eighteen middle school teachers from different subject areas in turkey. a maximum variation sampling method was employed for participant selection. the data was collected through semi-structured interviews. due to the pandemic the interviews were conducted using video conferencing applications. the data was analyzed through content analysis. according to the findings the teachers report that while they are effective in achieving cognitive objectives they have difficulties in achieving affective and psychomotor objectives. in addition the teachers do not prefer to design their own materials rather they mainly benefit from ready-to-use materials during emergency distance education. the teachers also reveal that direct instruction and questioning were the teaching methods and techniques they preferred in online courses and that they were unable to adapt other methods and techniques to distance education which resulted in students experiencing teacher-centered activities. moreover the teachers complain about students not attending the online courses on time or even at all their disinterest a lack of instant feedback limited communication with students and insufficient course lengths. another critical finding was that the teachers only use homework end-of-unit quizzes and participation to online courses as measurement and evaluation tools and agree that they are unable to administer reliable and valid evaluation tools. the limitations of the study and implications for future research are later discussed.
2021;learning analytics is quickly evolving. old fashioned dashboards with descriptive information and trends about what happened in the past are slightly substituted by new dashboards with forecasting information and predicting relevant outcomes about learning. artificial intelligence is aiding this revolution. the accessibility to computational resources has increased and specific tools and packages for integrating artificial intelligence techniques leverage such new analytical tools. however it is crucial to develop trustworthy systems especially in education where skepticism about their application is due to the risk of teachers' replacement. however artificial intelligence systems should be seen as companions to empower teachers during the teaching and learning process. during the past years the universitat oberta de catalunya has advanced developing a data mart where all data about learners and campus utilization are stored for research purposes. the extensive collection of these educational data has been used to build a trustworthy early warning system whose infrastructure is introduced in this paper. the infrastructure supports such a trustworthy system built with artificial intelligence procedures to detect at-risk learners early on in order to help them to pass the course. to assess the system's trustworthiness we carried out an evaluation on the basis of the seven requirements of the european assessment list for trustworthy artificial intelligence (altai) guidelines that recognize an artificial intelligence system as a trustworthy one. results show that it is feasible to build a trustworthy system wherein all seven altai requirements are considered at once from the very beginning during the design phase.
2021;background: changes have occurred in children's sleep habits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the purpose of this study was to compare the sleep patterns during the covid-19 pandemic of school age children of health worker parents (group 1) and non-health worker parents (group 2). method: one hundred twenty-two participants were included in group 1 and 250 in group 2. the families' sociodemographic characteristics (education levels and occupations of mothers and fathers parental shift-working status monthly family income number of children in the family and place of residence) general information for the children taking part (diagnosis of covid-19 or covid-19 related isolation distance education participation in sporting activities time spent watching tv time devoted to reading time spent on telephones/tablets/computers and time spent on indoor activities) and the responses given to the children's sleep habits questionnaire (csqh)-abbreviated form were all examined. results: group 1 consisted of 122 individuals 66 (54.1%) female and 56 (45.9%) male and group 2 of 250 individuals 129 (51.6%) female and 121 (48.4%) male. statistically significant differences were determined between the groups in terms of parental education levels and occupations family monthly income number of children in the family place of residence parental shift-working status and length of time spent on indoor activities. total cshq scores were 41.57 +/- 7.57 (20-60) in group 1 and 39.6 +/- 8.47 (17-68) in group 2 (p:0.03). conclusion: greater impairment of sleep habits of school age children of health workers compared to those of non-health workers in the covid-19 pandemic is proved for the first time in this study. further assessment of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on children's sleep habits is now required and appropriate measures must be taken in the light of the results obtained.

2021;with the covid-19 pandemic affecting the world the vast majority of students in various educational institutions around the world have changed their learning styles from the physical classroom to digital learning education. especially the fact that university students take their lessons with e-learning in times of crisis (covid-19 pandemic) has forced them to spend more time with the computer. this situation will also affect their academic motivation. this research aimed to test whether the fear of contracting covid-19 (covfc) had a moderating effect on the prediction of preservice teachers' academic motivation (amotv) with their computer self-efficacy perceptions (cse). with a combined approach a single model was employed to test the moderating role of covfc and the mediating role of attitudes towards e-learning (atel) in the prediction of preservice teachers' amotv with their cse. 522 preservice teachers from 21 different branches participated in this research. as a result of the research the cse of preservice teachers were determined to predict their amotv significantly and positively. the increase in covfc was found to have a negative moderating effect on the prediction of amotv with the cse of preservice teachers. also atel was found to have a partial mediating effect in the relationship between the cse and amotv of preservice teachers.
2021;recent developments in educational technology have led to a renewed interest in the utilisation of user-generated microgames for facilitating learning. the advantages and disadvantages of microgames which have been voluntarily created modified shared and used by users on open learning platforms to support learning are not yet clearly understood. the present study explores the strengths and weaknesses of user-generated microgames for assisting learning followed with some recommendations for the development and effective use of microgames from elementary teacher perspectives. this study is exploratory research conducted within the geogebra application with the participation of elementary school teachers from indonesia. the study found that on the one hand user-generated microgames have multiple advantages to support learning mainly by their simplicity and short duration gameplay. on the other hand the games have several disadvantages especially due to the lack of content directly related to learning objectives and less interesting interfaces. it is recommended for users of open learning platforms to create more targeted microgames respecting a particular learning objective and for teachers to creatively connect games to learning for mastering knowledge skills or literacies.
2021;the qualification of a preschool teacher is one of the important factors that determine the quality of preschool education. to increase the quality in education teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge starting from pre-service training and in-service training should support the upgrading of their knowledge. thus the aim of this study was to develop an e-mentoring-based education program (e-mente:pt) for preschool teachers and to test its effectiveness on their professional development during the in-service support period. the study used a design-based research approach. first focus group interviews were conducted with one-hundred-and-five preschool teachers to find out their needs. then an e-mente:pt program was developed based on these needs and devised to be used on the canvas learning management system (lms) which involves all opportunities of e-learning and allows one-to-one e-mentoring. the e-mente:pt program involved twelve modules related to the pedagogical content knowledge of the preschool education program. each module included contents goals module materials e-books videos pre- and post-module evaluation questions discussion questions live lessons and e-portfolios all of which were integrated in the lms. next eighteen full-time and nine substitute voluntary teachers from five different provinces were selected as mentees by means of criterion sampling. nine academicians working in these provinces acted as mentors and implemented the application each working with two mentees for two months. qualitative data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis and quantitative data were analysed by means of the wilcoxon signed rank test. the research concluded that the e-mente:pt program supported preschool teachers' professional knowledge learning environments and classroom applications and an e-mentoring based teaching management system was effective on professional development.
2021;this study aims to enrich a theme in the science course in the distance education process with augmented reality-based applications and to examine the effects of these applications on students' achievement and attitudes in science courses. a single group pretest and posttest experimental design was used in this research. the research group consisted of 15 third grade students attending at a school in siirt during the 2020-2021 academic year. in the research ar-based applications were designed for some gains aimed at the electric vehicles theme in the science course and these applications were shown to the students through the zoom program. this applications consist of 15 h including pre and post test. research data were collected through data sets obtained from success and attitude scales given before and after the application. the findings obtained from the research show that the students' achievement and attitudes towards the science course increased significantly with augmented reality (ar) based applications.
2021;background there are major changes in education strategies as higher education institutions urgently need to adopt distance education tools and practices due to the covid-19 pandemic. medical education is also trying to get out of this emergency using distance education. in this study we aimed to develop a reliable and valid scale in order to evaluate the perceptions of medical students towards distance education. methods the students taking part in the study were in the first five academic years of the medical faculty in bursa in turkey. at first 57 items were determined to evaluate students' perceptions. content validity was examined according to the assessment of the expert team. construct validity of these items was examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. also cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated for reliability analysis. the medical students' responses were scored using a five-point likert scale. results when the content validity was examined the number of items was determined to be 38 items. construct validity of these items was examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. because of the exploratory factor analysis performed on the responses of 429 medical students 22 items were included in four factors. this four-factor model was applied to 286 medical students and validated by confirmatory factor analysis. also cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated for reliability analysis and values were between 0.713 and 0.930. conclusions this study demonstrated validation and reliability of perceptions of distance education for medical students. we suggest a 22-item model with a four-factorial scale.
2021;purpose the aim of the study was to assess the quality of videos on youtube as educational resources for patients and physicians about blepharoplastic surgery. methods this study is a retrospective and cross-sectional study. a youtube search for the term blepharoplasty was made and the first 210 videos were recorded (all video searches were done by clearing all search history without any user login). the number of views likes and dislikes upload time (i.e. age) of all videos video duration and source (i.e. physicians non-physicians) were recorded. the video uploader physicians healthcare provider health-related channels were gathered in a group. video sources were evaluated as physician and non-physician. the discern journal of the american medical association (jama) and global quality scores of all videos were also evaluated and recorded by two experienced oculoplastic surgeons. results considering our exclusion criteria from 210 videos we evaluated 186 videos were included in the study. 147 (79%) of these videos were uploaded by physicians and 39 (21%) by non-physicians users. the total viewing average was 69548 +/- 14533. the average length (min) of all videos was 7.59 +/- 8.75 min. the average of total likes was 301.72 +/- 578.89 dislike was 28.47 +/- 68.90. the mean discern score was 45.06 +/- 12.88 (fair quality) the mean jama score was 1.39 +/- 1.06 (poor quality) and the mean global quality score was 2.39 +/- 1.03 (intermediate quality). discern jama gqs scores were statistically significant between videos uploaded by physicians and non-physicians (p<0.001). conclusions as a result of the videos reviewed youtube videos can be educational and informative for patients and physicians. only if the video source and content are selected correctly. we hope that youtube will become more useful in terms of healthcare and education once its role in e-learning is clear.
2021;the educational transformation of flipped classroom continues to be the important approach to increasing students' readiness for flipped learning. to successfully implement the flipped classroom students' readiness to use the materials delivered to them in the pre-class session and parent-school involvement should be part of the process to improve this student-centered learning approach. however little is known concerning the assessment of students' readiness to learn through the wbi in a flipped classroom and the role of parent-school involvement in student-centered learning approach. hence this study aims to extend the utaut model by considering the experience expectancy parent-school involvement perceived behaviour control and perceived self-efficacy factors to investigate high school students' acceptance of wbi for flipped classroom (fc) approach. a total of 320 senior high school students in english literature class were selected for the study using structured equation modelling to analyse the survey questionnaire data. the results revealed that performance expectancy effort expectancy parent-school involvement perceived self-efficacy and experience expectancy have positive influence on students' behavioural intention to use wbi. also this current study identified that the perceived behavioral control has an insignificant effect on students' behavioral intention to use wbi for fc approach. detailed results and educational implications are discussed.
2021;the web-based supported collaborative learning is increasingly used to support student social activities in higher institutions. however little is known about the factors of collaborative learning in a web-based supported learning environment. therefore this study examines the use of a web-based supported collaborative platform to enhance project-based student engagement. this research aims to determine the factors that determine collaborative learning and subsequent student satisfaction. moreover this research determines students' cognitive load understanding social influence and learner's motivation towards collaborative learning and the resultant impact of the web-based supported collaborative platform on student satisfaction. the data was collected from university post-graduate students who used the trello platform. a total of 115 post-graduate students participated in this study and the resulting data were analyzed based on partial least squares structural equation modelling statistical approach. the study results suggest that students' social influence and motivation positively influence collaborative learning directly and indirectly students are satisfied using a web-based supported collaborative learning platform to support project-based student engagement.
2021;in the covid-19 pandemic period most students felt lonely accordingly their motivation for self-learning was low. the study aimed to increase their enthusiasm for work and to improve their learning of biochemical subjects in the medical education programme during the pandemic period. small parts of educational materials (microlearning) were presented in different formats such as videos interactive education exercises game-based quizzes and final exam was taken. the achievement of learning objectives of the course was evaluated by a survey. students participating in daily activities gained higher self-confidence in learning and their final exam grade was higher compared to non-participating students (7.35 +/- 1.37 vs 7.06 +/- 1.88 p = 0.038). most of the students agreed that daily activities (52%) increased their motivation to work. this approach might be proposed as a practice that supports distance learning or even traditional education especially in medical education that includes complex issues.
2021;the use of personalised learning environments (ples) and adaptive learning environments (ales) in education has increased during the covid-2019 pandemic. thus the need of effective and high-quality ples and ales has emerged but developing such learning environments has some difficulties such as the need for a huge number of qualified e-contents. generation of e-contents for these systems is a time-consuming and costly process. moreover presenting the same e-content for each student is not effective because each student can have different intelligence type. to overcome these problems low cost reusable and dynamic e-contents can be used for ple and ale systems. for this purpose fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fahp) was used to provide sequenced e-contents for ple and ale systems. this proposed system was used in a case study to investigate its impact on learning process. the performance of the proposed study was compared with analytical hierarchy process (ahp) which is another multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) method also further statistical analyses were investigated. the results showed that 84.6% of students showed interest in the proposed system so the fahp method can be used for presenting personalised e-content effectively.
2021;this study presents a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of technology to develop critical thinking (ct). this review analyzed 57 publications from 2010 to 2020. with an inductive content analysis the study reached the themes related to the educational processes followed to develop technology-supported ct the characteristics of the technological tools used the findings obtained in terms of ct and the difficulties experienced in the implementations. the findings indicate that studies to develop ct mostly use writing-based practices through web 2.00 tools. the study observed that technological tools are properly integrated into the web-based learning approach. the practices in the studies include a number of dimensions such as the roles the teacher's undertake according to their learning and teaching understanding educational environment implementation periods and types of education depending on how the educational process works. themes such as accessibility technique insufficient experience in regards to prior learning social anxiety student resistance and mental fatigue emerged as the difficulties reported resulting from technological applications. this review evaluated the development of ct with skill disposition dimensions and ct indicators through the studies examined. the results of this study are valuable in terms of providing a perspective on what is necessary to develop ct by revealing the characteristics of studies that integrate technology into the learning environment. however the number of studies examining students' ct development in the first and early childhood periods is relatively low compared to other educational levels. therefore there is a need for more research related to the technological applications of early ct development in future studies.
2021;algorithms taken in the first year of university is one of the core courses of the computer science department. traditional learning systems have some restrictions as they are teacher class and time-based. however distance education is one of the popular concepts of today since it has the flexibility of time and choice of location. mobile learning which is a subbranch of distance education provides users opportunities to learn through educational mobile applications. in the present study an application to run on smart devices running the ios operating system for engineering students to be used in supporting the basic algorithm education is described. the student can both get theoretical knowledge about concepts of algorithms and test himself/herself with questions in the question bank. there are three types of questions such as multiple-choice true/false and flowchart designed by the dragging-and-dropping method. the main contribution of this application is that the users can design a flowchart from beginning to end on screen by locating any flowchart components provided on the palette. they also have the opportunity to check their own solutions according to the inserted questions and answers in the database. the application was tested on a group of computer engineering undergraduate students from mus alparslan university. in that case the application is evaluated by both an exam and user surveys. the results of the exam show that the presented application had a positive effect on students' success. besides the outcomes of the surveys have also given positive feedback.
2021;purpose during the covid-19 pandemic the distance education method started to be applied to prevent the interruption of education in universities. anatomy education given to students who will serve in the field of health has also been transferred to the online method in this digitization process. the aim of the study was to evaluate the emergency distance anatomy education by taking the feedback of the students of the health services vocational school and to make changes and regulations that will increase the quality of education. methods in the study a questionnaire was applied to harran university health services vocational school students. the link address of the online survey (prepared 5-point likert scale) form was shared with the volunteers. spss 20.0 was performed for the statistical analyses. results a total of 75.6% of the volunteers participated in the study stated that they preferred face-to-face anatomy education to distance anatomy education. 63.3% of the volunteers stated that distance anatomy education provides flexibility and time saving 65.5% of them provide the opportunity to learn at their own learning pace. 63.1% of the participants stated that they could not get their attention due to not being in the classroom environment. conclusion to increase the efficiency and quality of distance anatomy education for students studying in the field of health it is necessary to take into account the feedback received from the students and to make adjustments in the curriculum and content by considering the feedback.
2021;one of the objectives of this research is to develop and validate the instructional material motivation scale for single-use (imms-su) instrument in the turkish context. the imms-su was developed and validated in a two-phased process on a sample of 1654 students. the exploratory factor analysis revealed that imms-su included 14 items (chi 2 = 332.59 sd = 74 p < 0.001) the fitness indices were found to be rmsea = .077 srmr = .040 agfi = .88 nfi = .95 cfi = .96 and gfi = .92. the cronbach's alpha coefficients regarding the whole scale was calculated as alpha = 0.95. thereafter in the second study the animated and interactive video materials used in distance education were scrutinized in the context of openness to different materials time spent viewing motivation and cognitive load. a total of 933 students participated who had a distance education experience. in order to collect data the extraneous cognitive load instrument (kalyuga et al. human factors 40(1) 1-17 kalyuga s. chandler p. & sweller j. (1998). levels of expertise and instructional design. human factors 40(1) 1-17. 10.1518/001872098779480587) imms-su and questionnaire items were used. according to the findings it was determined that animation and interactive video materials did not cause a higher level of cognitive load on the participants and both groups had higher material motivation. in addition it was revealed that interactive video materials caused a higher extraneous cognitive load in participants than animation group. it was figured out that as the openness levels of the participants watching the animation and interactive materials decreased their cognitive load levels increased. in the light of the results some suggestions have been recommended for further research.
2021;this study undertook a bibliometric mapping analysis of research papers on open educational practices (oep) in the web of science and scopus databases. this study functions as a guide for new research serving to identify trends in the oep field and compare the existing research so as to identify gaps and promising future paths. a total of 635 studies were obtained however only 156 were finally selected for the analysis. vosviewer software was used to identify the most frequently used keywords and terms in the abstracts and titles. this software was also used to analyse the studies for co-authorship and citations. the findings showed that research on oep started in 2007 and focused on higher education including open and distance higher education. most of the oep studies were published in english as journal articles in particular many were published in distance education international review of research in open and distributed learning and open praxis. the united kingdom spain and australia were the top contributors to the oep literature. the analysis of keywords and terms in the titles and abstracts revealed that current oep trends covered only open pedagogy and open collaboration suggesting a need for more research on other trends such as open assessment open data and open science. the results also suggested that future research needs to focus more on inclusive open educational practices that accommodate students with disabilities.
2021;introduction: paramedic students should have the crucial cognitive and psychomotor skills related to neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n-cpr). study objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of blended learning on the theoretical knowledge and preliminary knowledge of the psychomotor skills adherence to the algorithm and teamwork in simulation-based education (sbe) of n-cpr. methods: this randomized prospective study was conducted on 60 fourth-semester paramedic students. the participants were separated into two groups following a classroom lecture. each group was assigned either a slide presentation (group 1 sp-g) or a video clip (group 2 v-g). all the participants answered multiple-choice questions (mcqs) and each group (group 1 and group 2) was divided into 10 sub-groups. these sub-groups were then tested in an observational performance evaluation (ope) consisting of a neonatal asphyxia megacode scenario after the classroom lecture and following the blended learning process. results: group performance teamwork communication skills and adherence to the algorithm were evaluated. there was a significant difference in the mcq and ope results between the after classroom lecture and after blended learning for both groups. the average score of group 2 was higher than group 1 in the mcq results (mann-whitney u test p <.001). the average score of group 2 was higher than group 1 in the ope results (mann-whitney u test p = .002). conclusion: blended learning especially video clips in adjunction with the classroom lecture were effective in acquiring and developing both technical and non-technical skills among paramedic students in sbe of n-cpr training.
2021;the purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of first aid training in live online classes using the problem-based learning approach on students' learning achievement problem-solving skills communication skill and interaction. the pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with a control group was used in the quantitative dimension of the study. the study group was conducted with forty-five university students. while live online classes in the experimental group were carried out via the pbl approach live online classes in the control group were traditionally carried out via teacher-based methods without any intervention. zoom application was used in both groups during live online classes. group work in the experimental group was conducted using breakout rooms. the process of data collection and the experimental procedure of the study was completed in six weeks. within the scope of the study courses took three 40 min periods every week. the learning achievement test the perceived problem-solving skills scale the communication skills scale and the online course interaction level determination scale were used for data collection tools. the results of study show that students who attended live online classes using pbl had higher levels of learning achievement problem-solving skills and live online class interaction than students who attended live online classes using teacher-based methods. no significant difference between the communication skills of the groups was observed.
2021;purpose to examine the effects of psychiatric nursing e-course taught by distance learning on students' beliefs about mental illnesses. design and methods this study was conducted as a pretest posttest and follow-up quasi-experimental study with 147 nursing students. findings the results showed that the psychiatric nursing e-course significantly reduced the stigmatization total and dimension scale scores of the participants and the effect continued in the follow-up measurement. the difference between the pretest and posttest stigmatization scores of the students who concentrated during virtual classes and those who found student-instructor interaction and virtual course materials sufficient was statistically significant. practice implications our results have shown that the psychiatric nursing e-course is effective on beliefs regarding stigmatization and distance education is promising for nursing education to continue effectively.
2021;the aim of this study is to determine university students' views on planning and conducting lectures in distance education teaching materials communication situations and the difficulties they experience. a descriptive survey model one of the quantitative research methods was used in the study. within the scope of the research a distance education student satisfaction questionnaire developed based on the experiences of the researcher himself and an information form containing the personal information of the participants were used to collect data. the data collection tool was prepared over google forms and delivered to 1632 university students via what sapp and mail. since the study was prepared in descriptive and scanning type descriptive statistics t-test and one-way analysis of variance (anova) were used in the analysis of the data obtained. descriptive statistics were used in the analysis of the first third fifth and sixth questions t-test and anova were used in the analysis of the second and fourth questions. according to the findings of the research it is seen that the anxiety of the students participating in the research is concentrated on the lectures and exams. students with self-discipline overcome this process positively while students without self-discipline often experience problems.
2021;this study aimed to determine the difficulties of teaching children with hearing loss in the special education centre during the covid-19 pandemic in turkey. sixty-three professionals who works children with hearing loss participated in this study. the demographic form included personal information about the professional' and a checklist to determine the effects of the pandemic on special education. lastly the professionals and the teachers completed 'the special education teachers' sense of professional self-efficacy scale'. an email or a phone message was sent to potential participants and interested individuals were requested to complete an online questionnaire by clicking on a link that led them to a secure online data collection service (google forms). statistically significant relationships were determined between professionals using virtual communication tools in the distance education contact with their students continuing the rehabilitation with them and providing consultancy support to their parents. while a positive correlation was observed between the professionals contacted with their students during the pandemic evaluating their students' development a negative correlation was found between their competencies to meet their rehabilitation needs and their counselling needs for families. special education specialists should be supported under special conditions such as the pandemic and informed about telerehabilitation options.
2021;covid-19 pandemic triggered distance education in higher education. decisions such as isolation social distancing and quarantine made by countries unexpectedly and suddenly forced face-to-face education to change to distance education within days. all academics around the world had to move online overnight. all the educational and academic activities in higher education (courses exams meetings etc.) had to be conducted online in a few days. based on these changes this study aimed to analyze the relationships among student faculty (adaptations of faculty members to distance education) and institutional (distance learning capacities of the universities) variables that affected satisfaction of the students related to distance education in higher education institutions in turkey during covid-19 pandemic using hierarchical linear modeling (hlm). the study group included 14962 students and 3631 academics from 30 universities. the results showed that universities with higher distance education capacities got higher satisfaction scores. hlm analysis showed that 43% of the variation in satisfaction scores resulted from universities. the second hlm analysis showed that 44% of the overall satisfaction score variance of the students could be explained by the factors of university features (level 2: distance education capacity and acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members). thus it was determined that 44% of the university factor calculated as 43% in model 1 (which is calculated within students' general satisfaction scores) resulted from the distance education capacity and the acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members. the findings of this study provide insights to improve distance education by stakeholders of higher education institutions.
2021;most universities worldwide had to temporarily interrupt face-to-face education and start emergency distance education (ede) due to the covid-19 outbreak. it is useful to identify the difficulties and problems that universities faced in this process in order that they can carry out a similar process more efficiently in the future. therefore this study aimed to conduct an in vivo examination of ede from the institutional perspective within the scope of universities during the pandemic period in turkey. to this end all state university websites were searched according to 27 criteria which were determined to set out the ede readiness status of universities. the results revealed that higher education institutions had difficulty in providing sufficient pedagogical and technical guidance to academic staff due to the rapid transition. with respect to students distance course contents activities and announcements were not equitably accessible for students from foreign countries and those with disabilities owing to the lack of information and communications technology (ict) tools internet connection translation etc. a remarkable number of higher education institutions preferred the features of distance education tools such as cost familiarity stability availability of technical support and short preparation time rather than their pedagogical affordances.
2021;research trends studies have emerged in education technologies (et) to determine research manner and changes. although the precedent examples dated back to the 1950s trend studies within et have gradually been increasing since the 1970s. this study aimed to examine the et publications and research trends in a 5-year time period from 2014 to 2018. with a bibliographic mapping tool namely vosviewer three research questions were addressed relating to collaborations concepts and citations in educational technology studies. the data set was extracted from isi web of science databases and included 1690 articles published in six educational technology journals between 2014 and 2018. we used co-authorship analysis to determine the collaborating researchers' institutions and their geographical locations (countries) when they published the articles. a co-occurrence analysis was used to investigate concepts. finally a co-citation analysis was employed to determine the most cited papers and journals. co-authorship analyses revealed that the number of articles published by researchers affiliated with institutions in the usa was the highest in the data set. according to co-occurrence analysis online learning especially in open learning environments was the most studied concept. moreover co-citation analysis showed that the most frequently cited articles were published in computers & education. additional findings discussion and limitations of the study were explained in the full text.
2021;model-free techniques such as machine learning (ml) have recently attracted much interest toward the physical layer design (e.g. symbol detection channel estimation and beamforming). most of these ml techniques employ centralized learning (clk) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a parameter server (ps) demanding the transmission of data from edge devices such as mobile phones to the ps. exploiting the data generated at the edge federated learning (fl) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning scheme in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to the ps for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge. thus fl is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than cl and applicable to the wireless communication scenarios wherein the data are generated at the edge devices. this article presents the recent advances in fl-based training for physical layer design problems. compared to cl the effectiveness of fl is presented in terms of communication overhead with a slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. the design challenges such as model data and hardware complexity are also discussed in detail along with possible solutions.
2021;the provision of online learning experiences has been implemented by many universities worldwide to overcome several challenges including inequality in education. however this experience is still not a common approach in public universities in the arab region. furthermore several research studies have pointed out that a country's culture should be considered in order to enhance online learning as students may behave differently based on their cultural backgrounds. nevertheless little is known about how a given culture may affect the learning behavioral patterns of students. therefore to better understand the cultural phenomenon and to enhance the adoption of online learning in the arab region this study aims to understand how an arab culture may affect the online learning behaviors of students. specifically this study applies a lag sequential analysis (lsa) approach to understand the behavioral patterns of 116 students from tunisia in a six-week online course. the study then further discusses the different learning behavior patterns based on the theoretical framework of hofstede's national cultural dimensions. the findings highlight that culture can affect how students engage in online learning discussions and how they maintain their learning performance online. the findings further indicate that online learning experiences may be beneficial for female students who experience social pressures in arab cultures.
2021;the purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of implementation and physical education (pe) teachers' perceived advantages disadvantages and encountered difficulties of online pe teaching during the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic. the participants were 1148 professionally active pe teachers from poland north macedonia croatia turkey bulgaria and kosovo (613 female 535 male). a cross-sectional online survey study was performed between may and september 2020 and was done online through an electronic questionnaire. study results suggest differences in evaluation of online teaching between pe teachers from different countries: a positive evaluation of online teaching reported from teachers from croatia poland and bulgaria neutral in turkey and a negative evaluation during that period by teachers in macedonia and kosovo. different ratings of advantages disadvantages and difficulties from the studied countries in online teaching in primary and secondary schools were also noted. a lack of proper equipment at home a lack of proper training for information technology (it) use as well as use of different platforms for online teaching were among the highest-ranked difficulties during online teaching. the greatest concerns during online pe teaching were identified in terms of pupils' safety the intellectual property of resources and the quality of curriculum delivery. the results from the study identify the most important areas of teachers work where pe should be supported regarding online teaching.

2021;background: the nursing department also completely switched to distance education during the covid-19 pandemic. this new situation made the studies regarding attitudes experiences and difficulties of nursing in-structors towards distance education more important. objectives: to determine the factors affecting the perceptions of nurse instructors towards distance education during the pandemic. design: this is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. participants: a total of 389 nurse instructors working at a university constituted the sample. methods: an information form and the perceptions of distance education scale were used for data collection. the data were analyzed using frequency percentage arithmetic mean cronbach alpha internal consistency analysis t-test one-way anova and kruskal wallis test were used in the analysis of the data. result: the nurse instructors' distance education perception scale score and perception regarding basic perspective and resource access subdimension scores were at a medium level and the education-planning sub-dimension score at a high level. those whose opinions on distance education changed compared to the pre-covid-19 period those who received education related to distance education those who used new practices in the lessons those who believed that distance education is effective and those who thought that nursing is a suitable program for distance education had higher distance education perception scores. conclusions: it was determined that difficulties experienced by nurse instructors in distance education negatively affected the perception of distance education and that positive experiences in distance education affected the perception positively. it is recommended to organize trainings for instructors to improve distance education skills to encourage students to participate in classes and to support nurse lecturers in overcoming difficulties.
2021;background: the covid-19 pandemic led to the suspension of face-to-face education and its replacement with distance education. this has caused important changes in midwifery education. objective: to determine midwifery students' opinions about distance education. design: this qualitative study employed an exploratory case study design. setting: this study was carried out at a national university in ankara turkey between december 2020 and january 2021. participants: the sample of the study comprised 50 students in the midwifery department. measurements and findings: data were collected using a swot analysis interview form developed by the researchers. the research findings were grouped into four themes: satisfaction with distance education barriers of distance education facilitating aspects of distance education and concerns about professional career . key conclusions and implications for practice: distance education in midwifery education in turkey was found to have aspects involving obstacles and concerns in addition to many pleasing and facilitating features. our findings suggest distance education can be used together with face-to-face education provided that its pleasing and facilitating aspects are supported and the obstacles and factors causing concerns are removed. inclusion of distance methods in midwifery programs requires curricula to be updated and support from instructors and students for the development of the necessary infrastructure. there is a role for employing bodies to faciliate practice-based learning for new graduates to address their concerns with a lack of practical experience because of covid-19 restrictions on placement.
2021;predicting students at risk of academic failure is valuable for higher education institutions to improve student performance. during the pandemic with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. this goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. this study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. additionally this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender degree number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials total time spent in online sessions number of attendances and quiz score. asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. the proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%. thus practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly.
2021;e-textbooks and e-learning technologies have become ubiquitous in college and university courses as faculty seek out ways to provide more engaging flexible and customizable learning opportunities for students. however the same technologies that support learning can serve as a source of frustration. research on frustration with technology is limited especially in educational settings. this study examined student frustration with e-textbooks and the factors contributing to the frustration within undergraduate general biology courses through the development of an e-text frustration scale (etfs). exploratory factor analysis of the etfs revealed a three-factor structure that provides quantified support for frustration with (1) e-textbook interactions on the screen (2) problems with technology and (3) e-text curriculum integration. this structure was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. the construct validity of the scale was established using a correlation analysis that revealed significant relationships among the three e-text frustration measures cognitive load and motivation variables. furthermore the measurement invariance analyses indicated that the scale measures the same construct in the same way in males and females. overall the study findings suggest that the etfs is a useful instrument with high reliability and validity evidence that can be used by researchers and practitioners. implications for future research on frustration in technology-rich learning environments are discussed. practitioner notes what is already known about this topic prolonged student frustration can be harmful to learning. educational technology may introduce an additional layer of factors that contribute to end-user frustration with technology. research on frustration with educational technology is scarce. what this paper adds we developed and validated a scale for assessing students' frustration with e-textbooks. the e-text frustration scale includes three factors: frustration with technology e-text screen interactions and e-text curriculum. the three factors correlated with students' e-text cognitive load and motivation to learn. implications for practice and/or policy the identified factors represent barriers to students' successful learning with e-textbooks. educators can reduce student frustration by aligning the curriculum with e-text materials. student sources of frustration with technology should be studied systematically to reduce frustration in technology-rich learning environments.
2021;the practice of microgame-based learning is relatively new and appears to have the potential to facilitate knowledge and skills acquisition in various educational settings. questions have been raised recently about possible scenarios in which to use microgames for supporting learning and instruction processes. the present study investigates teachers' perspectives and preferences for using user-generated microgames for facilitating learning in a variety of microgame-based learning schemes. this study is an exploratory research with the participation of southeast asian elementary school teachers within an online course on science technology engineering and mathematics (stem) education. in the study it is found that teachers have positive views about user-generated microgames and they prefer to utilise these microgames in the middle of the main learning sessions or mixing between different scenarios for flexibility to stimulate motivational responses rather than advancing cognitive processes. one of the most practical implications is to introduce teachers to the cognitive functions of playing educational games so that they are able to integrate microgames into their teaching practices in more meaningful manners.
2021;this study is aimed to develop a scale that measures university students' perception of using e-learning platforms by using the technology acceptance model (tam). the sample consisted of 636 university students. the exploratory factor analysis (efa) results revealed 5-factors on a 6-items scale. the five factors that were revealed on the efa analysis were called: content and pedagogy of the platforms perceived usefulness perceived ease of use attitude toward using technology instructional design of the platforms. the scale explains about 52.6% of the total variance. the findings obtained from the confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) were similar to the results obtained from efa. therefore the factorial structure was verified. in terms of reliability the cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as 0.85 and it was split in half and the reliability was 0.94. the cronbach's alpha values of five factors were found to be as follows: 0.93 (18 items) 0.92 (12 items) 0.76 (6 items) 0.75 (6 items) and 0.70 (4 items) respectively. moreover the results for the lower-upper 27% groups confirmed its discriminant validity. overall the present study achieved and introduced a valid and reliable measuring tool.
2021;background coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) has been challenging for patients and medical staff. radical changes have been needed to prevent disruptions in patient care and medical education. methods a web-based survey was sent to european society for pediatric nephrology (espn) members via the espn mailing list to evaluate the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on delivery of pediatric nephrology (pn) care and educational activities. there were ten questions with subheadings. results seventy-six centers from 24 countries completed the survey. the time period was between the beginning of the pandemic and may 30 2020. the number of patients admitted in pn wards and outpatient clinics were significantly decreased (2.2 and 4.5 times respectively). telemedicine tools electronic prescriptions online applications for off-label drugs and remote access to laboratory/imaging results were used in almost half of the centers. despite staff training and protective measures 33% of centers reported covid-19 infected staff and 29% infected patients. difficulties in receiving pharmaceuticals were reported in 25% of centers. sixty percent of centers suspended living-related kidney transplantation and one-third deceased-donor kidney transplantation. hands-on education was suspended in 91% of medical schools and faceto-face teaching was replaced by online systems in 85%. multidisciplinary training in pn was affected in 54% of the centers. conclusions this survey showed a sharp decline in patient admissions and a significant decrease in kidney transplantation. telemedicine and online teaching became essential tools requiring integration into the current system. the prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic may pose additional challenges necessitating urgent and rational solutions.
2022;background: the covid-19 pandemic has raised the need for distance learning in nursing education. the necessary precautions have been taken in nursing schools involving the application of various restrictions including the suspension of face-to-face classes and the closure of educational institutions and this has had a profound effect on nursing educators and nursing students alike. objectives: the study seeks to answer the following questions: 1) what are the characteristics of distance nursing education during the pandemic? 2) what are the nursing students' views on online education during the pandemic? 3) what difficulties have been experienced by nursing educators during the pandemic? 4) what are the views and suggestions of nursing educators in regards to nursing education during the pandemic? design: descriptive cross-sectional multicentered and international study. settings: an online survey was completed by 30 nursing educators working in establishments listed among the top 60 highest-ranked nursing schools in the world. participants: nursing educators in undergraduate nursing programs. method: an internet-based survey comprising open-ended and multiple choices questions was disseminated to 60 nursing schools on the 2020 qs world university ranking list. results: survey responses were received from 30 nursing schools in 30 countries. since the announcement of the pandemic the structure of distance education in nursing has taken different forms from one country to another and nursing educators and students alike have encountered a diversity of problems during this process. the findings of the present study reveal that 65% of the nursing educators thought that they had been caught unprepared for the covid-19 outbreak 44% thought that the nursing program outcomes had been achieved through distance education and 48% encountered internet-related problems. conclusion: we believe that the present study will (i) aid in the decisions of nursing educators considering a transition to distance education provide suggestions to those that have already made such a transition or inspire those seeking to improve the effectiveness of practice in obligatory cases (ii) serve as a guide for educational institutions and (iii) contribute to the taking of precautions to counter potential problems.
2022;background: it is important to know the rights of women and children while shaping attitudes toward gender roles violence against women and reporting child abuse. to shape attitudes toward reporting abuse women's and children's rights courses should be integrated into undergraduate nursing curriculum. it is important to develop positive attitudes of nursing students toward gender roles violence against women and reporting child abuse. objectives: the aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a women's-children's rights online-educational program in a nursing curricula. design: a pretest-posttest follow-up with a control group quasi-experimental trial. settings: nursing department of the state university in turkey. participants: fourth-year students (n = 62) of a nursing department at the state university in turkey constituted the study sample. the students were divided into two groups: education and control groups with each group comprising 31 fourth-year nursing students. methods: the education group took the women's-children's rights online-course whereas the control group did not. in both groups baseline assessments were performed online using the gender roles attitude scale violence against women attitude scale and healthcare provider attitudes toward child maltreatment reporting scale. the posttest (t1) was conducted immediately after the 14-week course was completed. followup was performed after 1 month (t2). numbers percentages chi-square test t-test kolmogorov-smirnov test pearson's correlation and duncan's test were conducted using spss 20.00 software. results: the education group's scores of attitudes toward gender roles violence against women and reporting child abuse/neglect were significantly higher than those of the control group (p < 0.05). after the online program a significant difference between the groups and between the measurements was observed in the education group (p < 0.05). conclusions: the women's-children's rights online-course is an effective method in educating and enriching nursing students on women's and children's rights.
2022;the flipped classroom (fc) provides various opportunities to ensure active learning in a student-based learning environment. in the literature it is pointed out that the fc model provided a positive contribution to the teaching process when it was used for learning environments in past studies. besides this it is seen that fc was integrated into a learning method and the results were generally associated with only fc. from this point of view it is thought that the methodological effect of fc needs to be examined. the aim of this study is to identify whether the use of different models (peer-assisted group: pal-fc collaborative group: sgcl-fc and individual learning: il-fc) in fc for computing courses of university students has an effect on academic performances learning motivation academic self-efficacy computer anxiety of the university students and flipped learning readiness. this study is designed with a mixed method. the working group of the study is composed of 242 university students. the application lasted for 14 weeks. in this study data have been collected by a personal information form semi-structured interview form information technologies achievement test and four different data collection tools. as a result of the research it is found out that different applications in the fc model have a significant effect on academic success academic self-efficacy e-learning readiness in fc. fc model application with pal-fc has proved more successful when compared to other methods in terms of developing performance and reducing technology anxiety. also it is seen that motivation and academic self-efficacy in fc has improved positively for collaborative group work.
